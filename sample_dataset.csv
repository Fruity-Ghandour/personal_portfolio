It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....",-1,0
5290769,40300,Risen,"Good game but the combat drags it down quite a bit. Maybe it's because I am missing something here, but the combat is not engaging and deep as the developers seem to have intended. Instead it's annoying and repetitive. The rest of the game is quite well done.  The world itself is very well crafted and cool. With many different environments and creatures to fight, it's fun to explore. Along with that which I very much appreciate is that there are areas where you will be very much under powered and will be squished like an ant if you venture there. Instead of the hand holding and area leveling that most other games in the open world rgp genre employ.",-1,0

Wings of Freedom,"  At the current moment, i can't really Advise you to get this game, mainly because you have to be some what lucky in order to not get the wild bugs this game has, if you manage to get by the bugs and actually play the game its great. but i was not one of those fortunate people. the controller bug and black screen that happens is a big bug that i hope gets patched in the future,   I did get this game for free for my birthday so i'm not too bumed out, but i have been hyped to play this game, to be honest i'm sure once it gets patched and all fixed up if they ever do it, I will be more then happy to change this review.  I really hope the developers of this game notice the game breaking bugs of this game and fix them.",-1,0

You are presented with a huge amount of missions to face and the game gets really challenging quite fast. You need patience and time.

3452907,282590,Star Ruler 2,"An enigmatic gem of a space 4X. If you loved Master of Orion, Sins of a Solar Empire or (particularly) Stardrive - you will love this unique take on RTS space sandbox!  This game manages to let you delve as far into the complexity as you want - customized ships, micro-managing every level 1+ planet, fleet management, etc. without forcing you to do really any of it that doesn't interest you. Some elements will be familiar - research, ship design and combat - but others are innovative and strangely rewarding - particularly the somewhat simplified planet level / pressure system.   This totally unprecedented approach avoids the common pitfall of having dozens of mediocre planets with long build queues to manage by linking multiple systems together to develop regional powerhouse worlds (a la Trantor from the Federation books). You could manage an empire of 25 - 50 systems that all feed into just 2-4 strategically critical commerce, research and production meccas. It takes a while to understand how to properly connect your web of worlds, but nothing matches the feeling of finally getting that level 5 capital pumping out the cash, research and *most importantly* giant behemoth led fleets.  Speaking of fleets - the ship design is both deep and rewarding - balancing many different combat roles in a somewhat simplified flagship + supports system. If you don't want to design your own ships, you can download interesting and unique creations built by the community. And the size and scale of the ships and systems is only limited by the size of your empire - with an infinitely scalable (and ingeniuosly 'economies of scale' based) size system. Combat is aesthetically beautiful, if tactically thin - but certainly rewards players for careful combination of forces and flanking / disabling manuevres (nothing like hitting a flagship with a disabling ion cannon blast while your backup warps in behind them for the kill!).  My only gripe is that the AI is unpredictable at best, and downright 'unfair' at higher difficulties - and the diplomacy system is only ok. It throws out the Civilization style trading and (most) agreements for an influence based card game where you can bid for and against certain empire and universe wide perks/debuffs. It's pretty easy to ignore - at least in single player. Victory conditions are also lacking, but I could see more paths to victory added in the future (activating the revenant is pretty much a sure thing as I discovered in my last playthrough - how much is 1.6G in supplies anyways...)  Overall this is a huge imrpovement on the original (which I tossed out pretty quickly due to its unapproachable complexity) and really a new game that stands well on its own. Worth the price of entry for any 4X or space buff that wants a fresh take on ruling a massive intergalactic empire!  ",1,0

Issues with server connections, connecting to the wrong games, maps not spawning correctly.

2662858,250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This game was, and Is an obsession of mine. It has been that way since the demo on Newgrounds. I found the demo loads of fun, and until I could afford enough TF2 items to buy a copy off of someone, I'd play that demo for hours. When I got the game, I was decidedly more than happy. It's the dark story, the gameplay that was exceptionally tight, not to mention loads of cool item combinations, and Wrath of the Lamb made it even better. Then I heard about the Rebirth.....at first, I didn't like the idea. In my eyes, the binding of Isaac was perfect in every way. Then I got a sneak peek at the soundtrack. Particularly the track known as 'Endless Hymn'. I was sold. Granted, it didn't have the charm of Mister Baranowsky's work, but it was in a league all it's own. For me, music in a game means a great deal.  As soon as it came out, I was stoked, I tried to get the cash to get the game....but I couldn't. Then a friend of a friend gifted it to me for Christmas. I was peeing myself with joy. I downloaded it, and started playing. The story was still delightfully dark, and the gameplay, save for a control lock issue, was still tight. I fell in love with The Binding of Isaac again. At current time, I've beaten all the bosses, and gotten all the endings. And yet the final ending puzzled me slightly. I shan't spoil, but I decided to look up something on it, and found a rather depressing interpretation of the cutscenes, and the items. And the dark story took a turn for the black.  The interpretation made sense to me....and it changed my view of the game...... But I'm still going to keep playing, oh yes indeedy, it's still the most beloved game in my library, and nothing shall change that. I wholeheartedly recommend this particular gem, either this, or the original and it's DLC. It's still worth playing, no doubt.  Thanks for sticking to this rather wordy review, cheers!",1,1

Aside from all the things other reviews mention such as graphics, game issues etc the biggest annoyance for me are the useless AI and the unfathomable difficulty levels in this game.  You run into average boss fights and beat them fairly easy and then suddenly out of the blue there is a boss encounter and you stand no chance in hell to win it.. so I guess the game expects you to grind like nuts on mobs which pose no challange whatsoever untill god knows what point and then beat the boss... very frustrating and annoying.. made me stop playing this game after 8 hours",-1,1

534866,203160,Tomb Raider,"More Tomb Raider? I've enjoyed almost every version and variation of Tomb Raider so far. How is the newest one?   The latest reboot of the series (who's counting?) is surprisingly gun-heavy (thanks a lot, Uncharted and Gears of War!), but it hasn't lost its sense of ambiance and adventure. Whew. This one could have been terrible, but it's actually pretty great. The old charm is still there, but with new tricks.  I still think most of the fun of Tomb Raider lies in exploring, and not in murdering thousands of enemies. This game begs to differ. But since even the murdering is pretty fun, and the adventuring is still there, the mayhem is acceptable.  The story and the characters are a mixed bag, but Lara herself is a fantastic protagonist - and is, here, in top form. The backgrounds are gorgeous and the environments look as pretty as a baby's smile.  Who knows where the series will go after here, and I certainly hope they cut down on the mass murdering a little for the next game... but this one is definitely one of the best entries in the series.

I thought 'that's your problem for not playing the game properly', and continued doing what I was supposed to do every round; planting the bomb.

3559798,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"Okay after 50 hours of playtime I CANNOT recommend this game, since the art-style is a matter of personal preferences I wont leave this out of the review.  Although I like the new concept of one wonder/district per tile, that still needs refining especially for wonders since the drawback of building one often negates its usefulness . Another thing I like is the religion and cityscape suzerain-overhaul  And that we don't have to buy dlc's to have religions and spy.   the worker-overhaul would be nice if it wasn't for the housing-mechanic encouraging you to build more farms than you actually need.  to be honest I am a little bit divided about the culture-overhaul. on one side we got the government-policy-card-system which I find a very good improvement to civ5 while I don't like the fact they reduced the tech-tree once again to add a second techtree in form of a culture-tree.   which brings me to the eureka-feature .. in my point not a good addition, I usually play marathon to slow down the tech-race so I actually have something from my units/builds but thanks to the eureka-system this isn't the case anymore. and having your units becoming obsolete twice in a standard speed game when you get them from one side of your empire to the other side is stupid, although the movement speed-nerv of the roads may have a hand in it ( hi railroad-dlc?)   the ui is the worst ui I have ever seen in a 4x game. not only does is lack in overview and function as well, for some information you need to mouseover ( which can get tedious with the tech ) while other like boarder growing, religious pressures and so on lack entirely.  about the AI, I could write an enire article.. starting from irrational behaviour on the battle field with catapults in a besieged city not firing, war declarations of ais who are friendly to you but cant even reach you or beat you because they are only one city left, the deal-AI is even worst than civ5 with either agreeing to the worst deal for them or trying to spam the player with the worst deals for them, which you cant even ignore. it really gets annoying when 4 ais spam you with 1 gold per turn offer each turn and you cant even ignore it in singleplayer like you could in multiplayer.   and then there are the bugs. those range from AI not claiming his great persons and stucking the world on 3/5 religions, to citystates getting constant revolts in the lategame, to AI putting down a military districts which can fire from the first turn without it being completed and so becoming invincible, to oil not really spawning on land, rivers not visible on the map or the AI able to declare formal war without having denounced you.  all in all civ6 had so much interesting ideas and potential but again, stupid AI who can only 'cheat' to not balance-tested features and the cancer of an ui .. and knowing the developer will not the care about refining it.",-1,0

4466534,34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,"So it's April 2016 and up until 2 weeks ago I have never played a single Total War game! I've heard of them, seen them on Steam and other places but somehow never played any. A few weeks ago I was looking for a new game to play and stumbled across EMPIRE, I liked it. So I got Napoleon meh, Rome 2 good, then Shogun 2...Shogun 2 has been on my drive for about 5 days and I'm close to 70 hours logged. This is a FANTASTIC game. I have since played every TW game except the OG Shogun. TWS2 is the best out of the series imo and perhaps my fav game of all time. I really love it. The graphics are good, the sound and atmosphere are top notch. My only complaints would be the multiplayer seems to be dead (at least for a new player like me, yet to matched with anyone) and toward the end game I seem to be getting my main Generals assassinated, but then again as a new player I'm sure there is better ways to counter balance this. The seige battles are my favorite part of the game, defending or attacking. The economy is really fun yet a challenge to manage throughout the game. Also there are a ton of mods if you want to jazz up the gameplay. In closing YES this is an older game but it's truly a must have for any RTS fan! Give it a few hours and you will be hooked!",1,0

1058851,217100,Dementium II HD,"Honestly, just play the DS game.   If you haven't yet, Dementium 2 is a fun little survival horror FPS with neat-looking monsters, limited ammo, and themes revolving around losing your sanity and blurring the line between real and fake. It's not the most revolutionary thing, but it's got some heart.  All of what I just said there applies to the DS version. The HD version did NOTHING to improve the gameplay, and it really shows. The enemies are easy to dodge now that you have WASD movement instead of DPAD+Touch screen, enemies require way too many hits to kill considering how little ammo you get, the level design is too spacious and devoid of much to do, and the sound is reused from the DS version in all its low bitrate.  These could be all surmountable problems if the combat had felt smooth and polished, but it's not. It's the same 'strafe back and forth out of enemy's attack range with melee weapons' combat you've probably seen in other games, and shooting feels stiff and lacking any punch. I attribute the latter's problems to the Unity engine (which this game runs on), mainly because I'm of the belief that it takes serious work to make something look/feel good in that engine. As an aside, if you do want to see a good example of a well-polished Unity engine game, take a look at Endless Legend.  Sadly, the game being 'HD' tampers with its general horror theme. Better controls means you aren't struggling against them during fights, better view distance makes areas that were once thick with darkness reveal just how empty they really are, and the lighting feels static and blandly applied. Even the animations for the weapons feel too floaty and lacking the correct feeling of power that they should have.  Ultimately, Dementium II HD just feels like a straight 'pretty-ing up' of the game, and misses the opportunity to refine and tweak gameplay to fit for a game free of the DS's tight resource restrictions. In many ways, the performance limits helped Dementium II feel tense and scary, but the PC version fails in that regard. Dementium II is a good game, but only on the DS.",-1,1

This game has no physics what so ever it is a game where you rely on numbers and memory of repetitive stats to release good games. It takes forever to unlock the ability to release sequels or multi plat titles. It does a poor job at exucuting the idea. Its possible to get good at it only if you know exactly how to play and once you know how to play you won't want to. If you truly have tens of dollars in your bank account and feel like wasting them its good for the first day or so when youre learning how to play, But afterwards it goes stale very, very fast.

4448856,342200,MechWarrior Online,"I have been playing MWO for quite some time. I am not a hardcore fan. I did play MW on the Playstation and PC back in the 90s.  MWO is a great game, there aren't many around, not many games that are not pay to win. A lot of cosmetics to your mechs and plenty of discounts and freebies. If you love Mechs or if you watched Pacific Rim and felt like you want a mech game I really do recommend MWO.  Bear in mind that the Mechs are sluggish, they are huge mechs after all, they also behave like tanks, legs and torso move independently. The game is quite similar with World of franchise.  In regards to gameplay, you can customise your mech with any weapons mods and gear you wish which is great as you will never meet the exact same mech on the battlefield. This is where the fun starts. There is no cookie cutter build, some would argue but really there isn't and I suggest to experiment and play YOUR way. Especially if you PUG and don't join a serious Clan. I did but I didn't like the fact they were dictating my mech set-up.  Quick do and don't list:  DO stick together with your team, else going alone you will get picked up and you will die. DON'T go alone unless you are very confident and you play a fast scouting mech, light/medium mech. DO quit the match once dead as you can start a new one without having to wait until end of match (something I did not know and wasted so much time looking at my team play, then again by doing so I did learn about mech setups and strategy) DO experiment with your mech, don't listen to people saying an Assault mech should not have LRMs. Many of the maps in MWO are LRM firendly. After all how will you get LRM 60+ if not fitting on an Assault mech? DON'T listen to Assault should never have LRMs on them. DO use LRM (homing missiles) when you first start playing regardless of the mech you use, it is a noob friendly weapon, hell it is a any player friendly weapon and you will do massive damage. DON'T go for Heavy mechs they are over used and will take forever to queue for a match. Also they take an Assault class spot. DO manage your heat, try to have rating of at least 1 heat management if not 1.2+ DON'T fire all your weapons like crazy, get heat spikes and shut down, you will die. Cycle your weapons if you must and go for double heat sinks but bear in mind they take 3 slots. You will be surprised how efficient it is firing 3 4 5 LRM's by cycling (BACKSPACE key) than all at once. Same goes for lasers if you overheat. DO Lock your targets, ALWAYS, no matter what mech you are in. You help others see the target and LRMs hit it. It also helps you see where the target is damaged so you can do even more damage by hitting the same locations. DO check your weapons details, especially range. Some weapons have a minimum range so if you shoot them at close range they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You would be surprised how many people shoot PPCs and LRMs at close range. Others that shoot them hoping to get people at 2Km distance:( DON'T test you weapons when you enter a game, you will just shoot your team mates and cause friendly fire. Use the Testing Grounds or If you must turn around find a safe area and do it but remember you will waste ammo if you use ammo. That 10 ammo wasted could make a difference when you have none left. DON'T block your team mates, and DON'T be a hero going first hoping to get them kills by blocking everyone behind you. You might get a kill but will also die and cause others to friendly fire you. I had highest damage in the game without any kills (you also get an achievd for this). Even with plenty kills your rating can be lower than someone that killed none but did most damage.   MECHS: Remember you need 3 different mech variants to level them up. If you buy a medium as your first mech you need to buy it's borthers too (2 more). You have to play all 3 variants get XP and level them up. There are 3 levels, most important ones are 1 and 2 as 3 only unlocks a new module slot. I would suggest going for the heat management skills first 750 and 1000 XP, then the 3500XP which does rotation.  LIGHTS: I have a few but I don't really enjoy playing them. Hit and run tactics, scouts, you will die very fast, frustrating for new players and for old. Can have a light 5x5LRM which is a trolling build but fun as hell. 8 9 medium lasers which wil do a lot of damage but do bear in mind that you have to constantly move and if you go toe a toe with any other mech you gotta circle it, move legs and torso independently to run circles around that mech. Something I can't do well.  MEDIUM: Similar to Lights but can be fun, they are quite fast and can pack a punch, would be used mainly as hit and runs, brawlers or LRM. You will be surprised how much damage 5x5LRMs can do (over 1000 damage in a match). You are an LRM boat that can move around the battlefield at 80 to 100 Kph. Can fit a number of high damage weapons. IE: Cicada with 4 ER Large Lasers which will be a great sniper.  HEAVY: My first mech was a heavy, the CAT, a lovely LRM boat, all I did was sit back and shoot a rain of missiles on my enemies:) I have the least Heavy mechs than any other one. They are great but everyone is using them and it takes FOREVER to queue up for games. As I mentioned earlier they also take 1 assault spot from the team.  ASSAULT: Well, what can I say about these walking fortresses. They pack a punch and can take quite a few. Just remember to stick with other mechs, mediums lights especially as they can protect you. You will be surprised how fast an Assault mech can go down if even 1 good light pilot starts running circles around you and shooting your legs. As you will need 3 different versions of the same mech I say have at least 1 LRM boat. When people say it is a waste of 100 tons, I say well my score and damage says something else. So many maps now are long ranged that if you have any other weapons you are a waste of 100 tons, especially the snow maps which everyone selects because they cannot manage their heat or because they are LRM or long range weapons.  As I said, experiment, you have 3 different versions of the same mech variant so you might as well go nuts. Put 10 medium lasers on an assault, 8 medium pulse lasers on another, 4 x 15 LRMs, 4 x LBX10 or 4 x 20LRMs. Same on heavy or mediums. By all means if you do not wish to get 3 variants, you don't have to, just level that mech up to level 1 of the skill tier and you are sorted. Since you will be making more money at start I would suggest to get an Assault mech first. Get one that has the weapons you need so you don't spend even more money on upgrades. Test the trial ones and remember if you buy the trial mech you have been using, it has the XP saved which is great as it can be used for skills once unlocked.  I would say to go for a Heavy mech first but due to longer queues it will take you longer to make the money back so I say get an Assault first then a Medium and a light if you fancy that (run the trial mechs first for as long as you need as it will help you decide which you prefer and you will also see the difference in queue times for the different mech sizes).",1,1

2378696,242780,Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller,"That was a really entertaining adventure/investigation game to play :  + Good story + Nice graphic style + Good voice acting + Interesing and logical puzzles + Rather good music + The cognition system, clever and interesting to use + Trading cards and achievements  - Moving characters is a bit slow - 3D models are not all that great - Starting at episode 3, I had some funny bug with Erica's model : from time to time, after a load or a cutscene, her model was completly freaked out ... hands in air, head pushed back against her back, and head spinning 360° permanently ... funny to watch but kinda breaking the mood. It stops after you start moving her again. - Some puzzles, though logical, are a pita (especially the one at the end of episode 2, requiring you to remember every insignificant detail of the case ... the map on episode 4 is also difficult, mainly because of the way it's presented) - Some achievements (especially episode 1) require you to replay, in a slightly different way, almost half of the episode case - Some dialogues or cutscenes can not be interrupted sometimes, not even sure if it's on purpose or a bug. - Some inconsistancies : Erica pulling her gun on her partner, entering suspect locations alone ... not very plausible.  Despite those little flaws, it's definitely a recommanded game, imho.  NB : Expect around 20h if you aim for 100% achievements.",1,0

4933809,379980,Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator,"In Panzermadels you play as a guy named Erwin, who is enlisted into tank school. You must search around trying to find the place, but when you do find the place things aren’t as you imagined. From there the game turns wild. The developer supplied a review copy for me.  I spent around 3 hours playing the game. There are 5 romance routes, but depending on your choice early then you may have an early ending. Each playthrough takes around 2 hours-2 hours 30 mins. I don't want to talk too deeply about the story but it's pretty wacky (in a bizarre sense) and there were always new surprises around each corner.   Positives  Choices – A lot of VN’s miss out on this part, they forget to let the reader have choices and gladly this game has an array of choices to choose from. Music – The music is well chosen and goes well with the game. Pretty creative and confusing – The game is highly creative, somehow associating vehicles with humans and managing to combine them.  Funny and didnt stop suprising me – Right from the start the ‘wackiness’ of the game had me laughing, especially the crazy drill sergeant. The game didn’t stop surprising me and the scenarios I encountered kept me laughing for a while. Art style is pretty good considering it's an indie game – Most indie VN’s I have played have had a more rougher art style but this game has pretty nice art and an abundance of backdrops keeping the game fresh. “Ammo Racks, Armored Plating and Amphibious attachments” – The game is completely riddled with Innuendos and most of the times I could not help but facepalm and laugh at what I was reading.   Negatives  Spelling errors – At the beginning there were a few spelling errors but nothing that major.  Only 5 save slots – This limits you to how many saves you can have. This can be a minor for most who love to save often. story crossing – This may be wrong but t34 give me number on hill then next day in class she had to give me her number again apparently and was reluctant about it. Lack of audio options and customisation – There are no real settings in options like audio sliders or font text.    Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game. Mostly due to the innuendos and randomness that the game is. It made me laugh quite often and I could easily recommend it to gamers who are looking for a game which is a bit more extraordinaire and bizarre. The price is a tad high but if you feel it’s not that much of a dent on your wallet then go for it.   The only qualm I have with this game is that sometimes I felt like my choices were not really remembered at all. I did have a fun time though and again, this was a real funny game. ",1,1
508442,202310,Ridge Racer™ Unbounded,"Ridge Racer: Unbounded was, to me, a very fun, yet repetitive racing experience.  (Be prepared to read a VERY descriptive review. TL;DR is at the bottom.)  The game's introduction is very simple, and explains to the player how Shatter Bay came to be, only to turn into a urban playground for the Unbounded. As a beginner, the player is convinced by the hashiriya master to join the Unbounded, and seeks higher recognition by moving up the ranks.  Now, if you've played any of the Ridge Racer titles preceding this one, you'll find that this particular title mostly leaves any traditional aspect of the older games in the dust. However, do note that Unbounded was produced alongside major game developer Bugbear Entertainment, the same folks behind the Flatout series and, most recently, Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Bugbear's role in developing Unbounded was one of the major factors in producing this game.  The single-player mode is very simple. The player has to race through the districts within Shatter Bay and dominate every one of them. These districts very in location and theme, from the lower parts to the docks to even the city center. Now, each district has a set of challenges that get tougher and tougher as the player moves from district to district. These events are filtered out into specific types, from the standard Domination Race to my personal favorite, Drift Attack. Unbounded also adds a ranking system to game, where you unlock more &amp; more features by gaining EXP and moving yourself up higher on the list. Now, from my playthrough of Unbounded, I found that these challenges often felt a little repetitive, considering that they all take place within their respective districts and can only offer so much in terms of visuals.  Gameplay is where Bugbear's changes come into light. The physics system is completely different compared to traditional Ridge Racer titles, with drifting through corners feeling more realistic instead of the old-fashioned 'go through a turn drifting at 300 km/h' approach. However, from my playthough experience, the physics of Unbounded are easy to adjust to, with a slight learning curve. There's new gameplay mechanics implemented into Unbounded, the most notable being Frags and Targets. Frags are the Unbounded equivalent of Burnout's Takedowns, where you can smash into another opponent in order to temporarily render them out of play. An awards system is also present, which gives awards to objectives you achieve as you're racing, such as hitting a particular Target or getting multiple Frags. Targets, however, pretty much lead me to my next point.  The game now introduces a destructive environment, where almost everything can be smashed into. DICE ain't got anything on the amount of buildings and coffee shops you'll be smashing through, as the amount of destruction the player will be causing to the city can put a smile on his/her face. And yes, there's explosions too. Small explosions. Big explosions. Michael Bay-approved explosions.  Aside from the carnage, there's a game mode that I'd like to recall: Shindo racing. This is pretty much the standard racing game mode, where there's no frags and no driving into buildings. Instead, you race against other Shindo class opponents around the city, with the winner being the first across the line. The game also features Time Attack, where you race against the clock in order to beat the timer.  One of the game's bigger selling points is the track editor. This allows users to build up their own personal cities for other players to violently smash through. Track pieces are unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player and multi-player. However, I found that making a city isn't exactly the best time-investing thing to do, but the option will be there should I choose to do so.  This game often goes on sale, and when it does, it's very cheap. I picked up Unbounded with all the DLCs for less than $4 during the Steam Winter Sale of 2014. The game made up the $3.74 I paid for it quite well, providing a solid single-player experience with the added addition of multiplayer (which, admittedly, I haven't gotten to yet).  TL;DR: Ridge Racer Unbounded is a game that I'd recommend as a means of trying new things. The revamped gameplay plus the added ability to create your own personal city to tear through offers a very entertaining experience for the racer fanatic. The single-player is a pretty decent experience, but it allows you to understand how the game works, so that you can begin dominating other players online.   ",1,0

The last straw for me was actually back in the Infamy update, where the cool bonuses we had were expanded into...just getting more masks. I stopped playing since then and I'm glad I did because from what I hear, it just went all the way downhill from there. Not to mention all the rebalancing done so that paying for the drills to the safes becomes necessary to get your weapons back to their old potency...  tl;dr Game is bad now, please avoid.",-1,0

2416401,243470,Watch_Dogs,"Short review while I come up with a better, longer, more in-depth one:  UPlay is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ and doesn't know how to work with the game's multiplayer. There is no reason for this game to be on Steam. Launching the game opens UPlay instead. Keyboard controls while driving suck, because a lot of cars are featherweight. Pretty much every driving mission is ♥♥♥♥ anyways. Most in-game menus don't have mouse pointers, not even the weapon wheel that is your entire inventory. This game's lead platform is PC, but the PC version feels like a cheap port of the XBox version.  But that's about all the flaws with it. Once you play it for a little while and get a good feel for how it works, it's wonderful. Of course, even some of the best computers can't play very well on the highest graphics settings (which aren't as great as the E3 preview, but honestly, who gives a ♥♥♥♥?), but it's still beautiful on some of the lower settings. The hacking works great, combat is cool, story's nice, and the multiplayer is pretty cool, if a bit annoying at times. I've put ~60 hours into this so far to get to the final storyline mission, and I can say I've enjoyed it. Yeah, a lot of the missions were just awful for various reasons, some because they involve mandatory, terrible minigames, and others because they make use of the bad driving physics. But getting through them was satisfying. It was a satisfying game.",1,0

From my point of view the game looks awesome, I don't care how they look on XBOX, PS.... after installing vjoy to get rid of the emberressing programming error on SE's part, and the game drew me in instantly. Its a game I see myself coming back to regular because I enjoyed the story so far and the battle system is pretty fun. I am exciting to keep going and see my character doing better and better in battles....  Don't turn away just because some people are complaining about the 740p issue, I am sure there will be updates soon to address demand for HD, but I personally don't think it will change the game dramatically. I am already seeing all the details on the character and in the environment. Unless you are talkiing about motion blur, AA settings. Higher resolution is a little bonus.

But if you like science-fantasy and Civ-like games, this is a must-play; it sucked me in in a way that Civ 5 didn't. The setting is amazing (I'd love to play this as a tabletop RPG) and most of the factions feel like they have a unique gameplay of their own rather than just having their specialties. My only complaint is the AI opponents who feel a bit week and often make incoherent decisions (Galactic Civilizations II set the bar really high for me; also devs say fine-tuning the AI is high on their priority list for updates), but the game remains deeply engrossing even in single player (and there is a multiplayer mode I haven't tried yet).

Its kinda sand-box, and there's nothing in terms of tutorial. You will have to read the manual, or click through to figure out how to control everything.  controlls seem to be awkward to play with, unit selection issimplistic and doesn't give you much information.

The idea and the core mechanic of the game is brilliant, I love how its almost a turn based game; to have a silky run through the level you find yourself thinking 3, 4, 5 steps ahead and trying to work out how best to do levels.   The only minor thing I dont like is that I smashed the main story in 3.6hrs. It seemed very rushed and could have been done a lot slower with more plot twitsts and more content (which may be added later with more patches but I am not too clued up on that) however I do not mind the one minor niggle I have that much.

Opponent kills me every time because I have nothing to block against. - Restart - Now tutorial works as normal - Do some story battles, boring and easy. - Get to a new tutorial on enchantments, tells me to win this turn. I have an enchantment that gives +1/1 to all my creatures - No creatures - Curse loudly - Restart again - Finally get to last battle of Gideon's campaign - First turn cannot play land or advance to next phase, get the error 'The game is busy.' U wot m8? - Wait 5 min, finally the game decides to let me play - I am just about to win, opponent has 2 life, no creatures, and I attack - Game crashed - The CPU literally flipped the table on me, took its cards, and went home - Uninstalled and never looking back",-1,0

It's been years since a game has come out that's only goal is to give you an enjoyable experience, and isn't focused on the money and advertising.   It's also been years since a game has been fearless enough to focus on comedy and the entertainment of the game rather than the gameplay and DLC's.   But that doesn't mean the gameplay here is bad. It's actually a very unique combination of an RPG and a bullet hell, whilst figurin out what makes your 'opponent' tick.   And even though I'm hilighting it being an enjoyable comedy experience, it can also get very deep and heart-tugging. It can even get... spooky.  This game gives you the same feeling of watching a childhood show and rooting for the protag. while having an overal good time. It makes you forget you're playing a game, all it does is make you smile, laugh, cry, and feel every other emotion ever.

Besides that; if you're a person that like exploring in these kind of games, then this is for your as well. The expansion brings a whole new scenary - away from the city - it's massive, compared to the previous areas.",1,0

6204990,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Civ V in space with some interesting new mechanics. Wait for a sale/complete edition unless you  really  want to play a sci-fi Civ V.  This is not Alpha Centauri 2. It feels more like a really good Civ V total conversion mod.  If you're a huge Civ/4x fan and you're someone who generally pays full price for stuff when they come out, then this might be a good buy.  For people who have patience, waiting is probably a good choice in this case. The game, as it is, feels unbalanced and rushed out. It feels like there are parts missing. Probably/hopefully, DLC will take care of this. There's a lot of potential.  Quests, Affinities and Virtues, in particular, are nice additions/re-imaginings of old mechanics.  Diplomacy is as atrocious as it was in Civ V, though. Possibly worse, since there's no diplomacy in regards to Stations (the rough equivalent of City States in Civ V). The favor system is a great idea, but terribly implemented.  Bottom line: Is it fun? Yes. Is it worth full price? No.",1,0

For example an employee might be unhappy, you open the management panel to track them down, it covers literally the entire screen. So yes, you can locate this employee, but you can't even see the park or employee behind this massive panel with tons of wasted empty space.  -Balloon booth is great but almost no one wants to buy balloons even at 1/2 the normal price. -Animations of people getting onto a ride doesn't exist, they just sort of pop into the seat. -no obvious benefit to promoting certain staff like entertainers or janitors -staff of a type all looks the same, they should have some variation like the customers. Janitors are all old redneck looking guys with scraggy beards, etc.   Still, this is by far, far far, the best Roller Coaster sim out there.

Slow, kind of tedious and lacking the more massive army/Age of Empires level of military combat and absolutely no town/castle building - it still proves to be enjoyable for something slow-paced and involved. You're always having to keep on the lookout for people trying to cut down your alliances and expanding your own alliances is a must to win truthfully - the combat is a bit clunky and simplified and it really is a pain having to worry about holding alliances with every town instead of just marching a massive army on them - but the game isn't /terrible/.",1,1

Just drop dead in front of me, I get my gun shooting as much as I can retreating into the garage. Don't forget the zombies chasing me!

1480807,222880,Insurgency,"If you're like a small fraction of those players out there longing for a more tactical shooter, a game in which tactics are worth more than twitch reflexes...look no further than Insurgency. I'm no combat veteran, but this game definitely comes pretty close to delivering what most descriptions of combat are like (barring, of course, the terror and the permanent death of friends). I wouldn't go so far as to call Insurgency a simulation, but it's definitely more geared toward a realistic portrayal of infantry combat - the only thing really missing is true ballistics drop.  If you're new to this game, be prepared to die...A LOT. Until you get used to the pacing (slow, careful movements into position and firefights over in a matter of seconds), you'll likely find yourself getting killed by the game's challenging AI or other players online. But this is a tactical game, and in most game modes you'll find that playing the objective is more critical than who racks up the most kills. Pick a Support/Machine Gunner class and suppress an area, deny the enemy easy access...jump in as a Breacher/Scout and get up close with the enemy and cap points. It's a bit of a steep learning curve, but the training mode does a pretty good job of prepping you for the online modes. I recommend Push or Coop modes until you get used to the combat system. It may take a while to click, but if you put in the time and are patient enough, you'll probably fall in love with this game as I have.  In my opinion, this game has the best class system of all the shooters on the market - each class is restricted to a certain grouping of weapons that suit its role and support points to gear themselves out. Want to carry extra ammo and a few grenades at the expense of movement speed? Go for it! Maybe light armor, a smoke grenade and only a primary full geared out are more your taste? Roll with it. You're allowed a great deal of customization and each weapon and attachment has pros and cons to it...keep trying variations until you figure out what you like best. You'll find a good collection of modern weapons in the game, plus a few surprises (M1 Carbine and MP40, I'm looking at you).  Now, this is far from a perfect game - since it's a Source engine game, you're still going to find several of the problems associated with Source present. Namely, the occasional wonky hit detection (and the ability for some users to mess with their settings to make it harder for them to get hit) and graphical engine bugs, but these are relatively minor and aren't game breaking. The biggest irritation for me is the rather odd sniping/long range mechanic...getting nailed by someone with a carbine/SMG at extreme range is frustrating; especially when a true-to-life ballistics engine would be nice to really give snipers more of a critical role. While penetration is modeled, it can be odd...there are sections of certain maps where carboard boxes will stop bullets (ha!). If I were to nitpick, the inclusion of the stockless MP5K over any other of the veritable MP5 series is a rather odd choice.  I remember playing the mod back circa 2007, and boy has it grown and changed in the years since then. I'd have paid money for the mod back in the day, but now that the game has been released standalone and is considerably prettier and more polished, it's worth every penny.",1,0

I loved Enemy Unknown and this is a worthy real time shooter 'conversion' of it.

3410418,280220,Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal,"Some are calling this tower defence. I'd call it real-time strategy. Regardless, I don't normally like tower defence or RTS, but this game is the exception to both. Maybe that's because this game takes those ideas and adds a simple but robust concept for the enemy units that you're fighting against.  The best news for you is that you can play a free demo of all the Creeper World games on the web via Flash or Unity webplayer. If you want to find out what people are gushing about, just go try the demo. You don't have to download anything (other than the browser plugin), just play it in your browser. If you like tower defence or RTS, definitely play the demo. Even if you don't, but you're somehow reading this out of curiosity for this game, try the demo anyway. Take if from a guy who normally dislikes both of those genres, and just look at how many hours I've played Creeper World III.  This is essentially a much-improved version of the first Creeper World. The game has a built-in map editor, and also seed-based procedural generation for random maps. This is in addition to hundreds of pre-made maps of varying difficulty.  As of the time of this writing, this game still has an active community of dedicated and gifted players who are still adding custom maps each day. There is much opportunity for modding. In addition to the map editor, there is a built-in scripting language so you can essentially reprogram the game (within limitations I imagine, as I've never personally experimented with it), and I've seen players come up with some very creative ideas such as maps where you play as the Creeper and maps where the enemy has units similar to your own that are controlled by AI, maps with fog of war, maps with booby traps, and the list goes on. The mods and customization make available endless hours of entertainment.",1,0
269727,113400,APB Reloaded,"Don't bother with this game.  There may have been a time when this was a fun title back when it first came out. That ship has sadly set sail unfortunately.  Having played this game both before and after it hit steam, it hasn't made enough changes to the formula to really be worth your time unless you are looking for excuses to break your keyboard/PC in a fit of rage.  The teams for missions/combat are hopelessly unbalanced 4 times out of 5. With rookies/new players often taking up 3 of the 4 players while the other team is full of players with 800+ hours whom know every in and out of the maps. Whom have the best gear and customized vehicles and clothes money can buy (both with in game currency and microtransactions).  The vehicles handle like garbage. If you have even the slightest lag whilst playing this game may god have mercy on your car's steering, the game will not.  The ONLY reason I would suggest even remotely looking at this game is for it's customization. I have never seen a game that lets you get so detailed with everything from each article of clothing, to the decals on your car to even the soundtrack that plays for someone when you kill them.  -pi/10, would rather get in a fist-fight with pack of half-starved hyenas",-1,0

The fighting system will require some learning, there are quite a few things to have in mind during a fight. The game has excellent tutorial section, you'll probably want to replay it a few times to get the hang of things. The roster is big and every character feels unique, so you have plenty to choose from.   My only (minor) complaint is the graphics, its really poor. Textures are sharp, but materials and shaders are basic, the environments have poor lightning and are barely detailed. You can see that in transitions between screens an arenas, and in the story mode in particular, where some sceneries look like in some old MMOs. It's kind of weird for a 20 GB download...

2911607,255220,,"I do recommend Grid Autosport with a few hesitations. The graphics are stunning, the car models are great and the game is for the most part very well optimized for most mid to high end systems. The controls are very well executed, they feel smooth and responsive.   Unless you're a hardcore racing purest I'd say pass this one up since you have no ability to choose and customize your own vehicle, they're preselected for you based on the sponsor you choose before entering into a season. The other part that bothered me significantly is that when you are leading a race your opponents appear to gain a significant speed boost and they easily overtake you and speed off into the distance as if you're standing still. The only way to midigate this issue is to turn down AI difficult which will actually impact the amount of xp you earn. If buying through steam I highly discourage it since Grid Autosport is not worth $40+ instead pick it up cheap on sites like GtwoA etc then I recommend it as a fun and addicting time sink for a few days until you grow tired of it.",1,0

708413,20710,Mr. Robot,"It's a cute little turn based RPG with a charming story involving robots that have just enough AI as to exude personality in the way WALL-E's robot characters did. The fighting moves have just enough variation, and anyone that's played a JRPG in the last 20 years will have no trouble identifying the 'physical,' 'magical' and 'AoE' moves. There are some places where you can choose to grind up character stats by revisiting enemies in cyberspace if needed, but you also seem to be able to pursue the story without being gated. The 'maze' of the ship and platforming are interesting without being overwhelming. The combat has a bit of a Shadowrun inspired feel to it which will make you grin with nostalgia.  For a cheap little indie RPG it's fun. It's not going to blow your mind, but for a casual time waster it does the job splendidly, hearkening back to simpler times. Sometimes you just need a break from modern real time RPGs that require 100% of your focus and engagement, and this game understands that.",1,0

As for the board game itself, it is strategic and occaisionally random enough to make it interesting.

5728578,4760,Rome: Total War,"For an old game, it's pretty well made and executed. Definitely worth 10 bucks.  I used to watch a lot of Rome Total War let's plays and I got pretty excited when I was able to download this from steam. The game starts you out playing as one of the three Roman factions, all of their intros distinct and unique. As I started the campaign I had a mixed sense of awe and fear. My first playthrough as the Brutii I enjoyed ravaging the cities of Macedon, Thrace and Greece. I did play on easy but there were some battles along the way that had suprised me and kept me emotionally invested in my campaign forth to the east. I remember countering the Phalanx heavy armies of Greece, Thrace, and Macedon, with skirmishers, artillery and archers whittling them down as they marched toward me. The same tactic worked for every battle with me always taking the hill. However I remember being annihilated by being caught in-between reinforcements and the main Macedonian army. I won, I lost, and I would never make the same mistake again.  After deciding to raise the stakes (Hard/Hard) and playing as a much less civilized faction (Germania) I found myself squished in-between the armies of Gaul, Britannia, and Dacia. I began my campaign reuniting the german people and invading what is now France and Britain and then proceeding into the territory that is known today as Austria. My empire was huge, to the west were the Spanish and to the east were the Scythians, and to the south were the Romans. With the Spanish and the Scythians at peace with me and Dacia all but scattered across the lands, I began my march into the Alps and into Rome itself.  For the Romans, it seemed too late, battle after battle I left their Hestati and Principe armies defeated and scattered, their war machines burnt to the ground and their cities pillaged and burned. They could not stop the hordes of horsemen nor the cries of the beserkers, Rome was crumbling. However, I faced as much more devastating enemy as I conquered their cities, holding them. There were constant rebellions and with the Romans building navies and giant army stacks at sea (and then landing in my territory) I had a rough time with them. When the Romans took a city, I couldn't take it back, simply because their walls were too strong to hold at siege. The Julii and the Scipii were battling the Numidians and the Carthaginians to the south, and then using the wealth from those campaigns to take back their homes. The Brutii were marching entire armies of Urban Cohorts, Legionaries, and the Praetorian Guard at my doorstep. Soon, my economy collapsed and I had begun to fear the threat of being overrun. I could take Rome, but could I hold it? After countless battles I eliminated the Julii and both the Brutii and Scipii were on the run. My armies all had silver/gold chevrons weapons and armor (upgrades) after such battles, so I was able to defeat many of their experienced warriors.  Then I decided to download Darthmod for Rome....  Every battle against the Romans was different than before and it had me running scared. I fought smaller army stacks and although I would outnumber them my men would leave the battle completely depleted. I couldn't auto-resolve otherwise I would end up losing and with the Egyptians, Pontus, Thracians, and the Spanish barbarians marching toward my gates I had one hell of a time. All in all, I had more fun than any other game I've played. The mods bring me back, and the battles are fantastic. Rome: Total War is certainly worth the money.",1,0

5937183,529950,12 orbits,"Very well polished multiplayer game. I have been playing it on my 10' Intel Atom based tablet and the game has run flawlessly even when tested with 12 players (all me during testing) without any visible dipping in performance.   PRO'S • The multitouch works great and the way the game handles assigning controls is really fantastic, it puts 12 tiles around the screen and players can tap whichever is closest to them to play. Since it is a single button game players just need to tap the edge of the screen in their area while playing. The game can be paused by tapping the centre of the screen. • On physical hardware controllers you can press any key on your keyboard and that will be assigned to a player, press it again to unassign it. Once again a very intuitive system. • The menu animations are also very very slick and make the game really easy to navigate. • The different gameplay modes are very easy to understand. This means there is a very low barrier for entry allowing anyone to play • However the game modes are also hard to master which makes them fantastic for competitive play. • Very low price. Goes without saying that the price is very very good, especially since it is a local multiplayer game meaning you only need to buy 1 copy to be able to play with many people.  CON'S • The menu music is very repetitive, however you can turn it all off which is more ideal for playing with friends. • When the game is paused there is a 3...2...1... countdown timer when resuming, it takes far too long in my opinion. Half the time would still give everyone adequate time to get ready and in place. • Maybe it would also be nice to have an option to double the menu animation speeds. They are very nice but I find myself waiting for the animations to complete. • When using keyboard it would be nice if player colours were mapped to the screen based upon their location on a keyboard. This makes no effect to gameplay since the colours are only there for touch screen controls but it would have been a neat effect. • It would maybe be nice to slide my finger over the options in the settings menu rather than having to tap the arrows to adjust volumes. Not a big deal at all though since it is set and forget. • No online multiplayer, it would be neat to have. Its also a ballache to implement well so I can understand why it isn't here.   So I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple fun local multiplayer game. It may seem like I have listed a lot of negatives but they are all very very minor things that have little effect on the gameplay.",1,1

Miyazaki makes a return after working on Bloodborne during the development of DS2, and his presence makes the game so much better. Elements that were present in DS1 but absent in DS2 make a come back, and there are also elements of Bloodborne. Combat is now very fast paced, which was hard to get used to at first, but makes the fighting more involving. The first few bosses were not very difficult, probably just a way to slowly introduce new players to the series. However, at one point in the story, the difficulty level of the bosses skyrocket, which paves a path to many exciting challenges. Multiplayer has constantly improved in the series, and this game is the best of it so far.   10/10",1,0

1615386,224540,,"Ace of Spades: Battle Builder took one of my all-time favorite games (Ace of Spades Classic) and completely ruined it. This newer version is the abhorrent, deformed child of a beatifully designed game. AoS:BB makes its first mistake in the addition of classes. AoSC focused on pvp balancing as opposed to asymmetrical game design, which AoS:BB fails to implement well. Additionally, AoS:BB threw away fan-made maps for a while, and has now added them back in a terribly-done way. AoS:C did maps in a .vxl format, meaning things like .png files could become maps. AoS:BB, however, uses an in-game map editor. AoS:BB has one sin that is more unforgivable than all others combined, though: terrible optimization. AoS:C's tagline was 'run's on your grandmother's old rig.' AoS:BB runs rather poorly on my PC, and I have constant connection problems, despite my ethernet connection. Don't buy AoS:BB. Ever. Go get the original for free off  www.buildandshoot.com  It's fantastic and it's not this mediocre piece of butt.

However, the elements that make this game so hard aren't great enemy AI and challenging gameplay, but repetative and frustraiting mechanics that seem like they're creating just to make this game so difficult.  There's a reason modern games have adopted frequent checkpoints - restarting areas again and again is more annyoing than fun. Losing what you'd spent the last fourty minutes farming because one enemy managed to pull off a suprise combo just makes me wondering why I'm devoting free time towards something that feels like work.  Watch some of the boss battle guides on youtube - most of them direct you to use some kind of exploit to win instead of describing a strategy to use to actually beat the boss fairlly. That's because most of the fights consist of blocking/countering again and again...that's it.",-1,0

I wanted to give this a try, after i read it was updated and fun.  Lucky weekend, its free to try!  installed the game, run it, it gives you no options, just right into the game. Ok in game(after a lot of wasted time) go to the settings, I cannot get it to go into full screen mode without crashing. have been working on it for an hour. no real solutions to be found. I have disabled overlays, tried defaults, and auto detects. nothing.  As i am so tired of seeing the WARNING SCREEN at the load up. i may or may not try further to remedy the problem.

2935321,255710,Cities: Skylines,"Okay i love this game! i wouldn't call it a simcity clone its everything simcity 2013 wasn't, the graphics are amazing, but befor you buy the game itself note that the game does not run on older systems and needs a pretty good graphics card for it to work, anyway the game is worth more then its offer it gives you more then other city builders, the snow and night cycle is amazing the city slows down morn theres less trafic in your city in winter, at night theres more crime rate (for me atleast) but it does have it flaws like citizens not getting to work on time due to the traffic the roads are always packed with cars,trucks,buses unless you plan your roads right you'll gonna have a bad time with your city, also the buildings them self are a issue if a person dies in the building and it takes to long to get the dead person body out the building is abandoned, the trans system too is an issue i have problems getting my trains to leave without getting told theres no railing and i've checked dozens of times and theres no missing rails, the ems/police seem pretty okay, the airport sometimes just refuses to work, and if you don't have a fire station in the city close enough a house will end up catching on fire and if the fire ems don't get there in time you're city will loose rep. Anyways should you buy it? well it has its issues but most of them have been patched the game runs perfect on a nivida graphics card, but you'll need a beast pc to run this game i have water cooling and it runs pretty okay with that, fans i don't know but i'm sure it'd run fine, unless you have a pc that does not run games like star trek online,team fortess 2,modern warfare,battle field etc, i would not reccomed that (bad english) But would i suggest getting it? YES a thousend times yes that game is perfect simcity left out so much but i wont put to much hate on ea for simcity, anyway yes get it if you want a city building game, cities skylines delivers so much i can't even discribe it anyway i'd suggest buying it on sale but dont let me stop you from getting the game.",1,0

4396800,337070,"Dimmdrive :: Gaming Ramdrive @ 10,000+ MB/s","In order to use a ramdrive efficiently, you need to do some basic math. 16 GB system ram - (1 to 4) GB for the OS = X GB left for the game + ram drive. Find out how much peak memory usage a game has by playing and checking task manager (Details view, select columns peak data set).  Pay close attention to the amount of memory available during play. If you notice lag, open task manager, if memory is full then you should load a smaller ramdrive or get more ram. Even if you only select textures or audio files, it would result in a noticeable decrease in loading time.  Loading times are reduced significantly, even when you play games from an SSD.  Some loading time remains, as not all loading time is used just to load textures, there are almost always some decompression and setup steps.  You can also use the ramdrive to increase speed of temporary folders (my favorite io hogs are my browser, unity3d GI cache and photo/video editing scratch disk)  Dimm Drive is easy to use, but does so at the price of making it a little too easy, if you get bad performance check your memory.  If it is full, windows will resort to the swap file on your storage drive, which is slow even if it is on your SSD.

Apart from wandering around endlessly finding nothing but ♥♥♥♥ on the floor it is funny to throw your player off a cliff and respawn with your rifle because if you were hunting and you fell down a cliff you would need to be bear grylls to survive it because bear grylls hunts with the name bear in his name so he hunts grizzly bears and brown bears.

However, if you really give it a chance I feel like it will at least give you some idea of what living with depression is like.  More than a few times while playing this, I had tears in my eyes because the writing perfectly depicts the feelings of anxiety and feeling like you can't even face the world.

5916323,51100,Tactical Intervention,"Overall I tagged it 7/10 because first you still cannot aim down the sights (similar to some Counter Strike games) ,second your sprint energy wears out every 5 - 6 seconds. Third,every weapon in the game costs much that sometimes make players feel like they have a long way to go before holding a single weapon they want. But why a 7? I see the love developers put in to this game. This game even runs well on some weak computers even playing it on good FPS. The shading and graphics are awesome. Movement is realistic with certain movements not really common to other First Person Shooters such as rolling. Violence is perfect with bodyparts that can be torn apart especially blowing your enemies with your shotty. Last thing is that who simply thinks about rappeling in a game? FIX Games does. Credits goes to them. 10 stars if FIX Games read this review which I hope they do, and fix all the three problems me and some players are having in the game.",1,0
4823845,37000,The Void,"The Void is the most unique and enjoyable game I have ever played. Visuals are astounding, the soundtrack is a delight, the gameplay is engaging and the dialogues are enchanting. Tension gives so much joy that after finishing one playthrough I instantly began another one to reach a different ending that is more difficult to achieve. I have an impression, however, that this game is not for everyone. Nonetheless, those who will be sucked into it will be held spellbound. To appreciate this game you must have an open mind towards unusual games, enjoy gloomy settings and imbibe poetry. In my opinion, whatever your taste in games is, Turgor deserves your time to give it an honest try. Do keep in mind, however, that it is one of the most difficult games I have ever played and the player is constantly faced with a challenge to stay alive and to cultivate enough colors for himself and for the sisters. I only completed the game successfully during my fourth playthrough, failing the first three attempts. This might discourage a lot of people considering most modern games are made to be completed without much difficulty in the very first try.

2723887,251990,Long Live The Queen,"The game trailer on Steam says it very well! You guide the princess Elodie on her 40 week journey to coronation by choosing, week by week, what classes she will take and what skills she will build. In addition, there are a number of events during the week where you get to choose how Elodie will handle them, which often impacts what skills she can build, or at least how effeciently she'll be able to build them. Some events will always happen no matter what, while many others happen in reaction to the way you handled previous events. Many of these events are deadly.  Within that framework, there's a lot of player choice and immense replay value. It's impossible to build all of the skills in a single play through, and it's very difficult to anticpate which skills will be the most important when you first start out. It will probably take a few tries to get Elodie all the way to her big day without her being poisoned, stabbed, shot, or blown up. Even when you do, though, the game still has more to offer. As the ending screen reminds you, Elodie's story doesn't have to end this way, there are many other options to explore.

1760010,228300,Remember Me,"Just finished the game, and I honestly think it's one of the most, if not THE most, underrated beat'em-up style game I've ever seen. Personally, I am not a fan of games where 'you just press a couple buttons a bunch of times and eventually the bad guys will die' - even ones that have combos and stuff. But this game totally broke that barrier and left me wanting more after each play session. From the amazing story, to the intense music, to the awesome voice-acting, to the easy but fun combat system - it was just such a refreshment to see such a game do what it did the way it did. DONTNOD really pulled out all the stops with this one - and it was only their first game! I would like to note that this game is incredibly linear - so if you don't like being told exactly where to go and what to do, except for the bonus collectables you can get when you stray from the beaten path, it's possible that this game isn't for you. But I personally enjoyed this game a ton and will certainly be replaying it for Achievments later on - and I will definately be on the edge of my seat, waiting for what DONTNOD has in store for us in the future.  The art style is amazing, the writing is awesome, the music is super futuristic and crazy, the combat system is really fun and intuitive, and all of this comes together to keep you really engaged in what your doing. Some negatives I have for this game include the constant feeling that you're being herded in one direction by the game, the some combat CAN get kind of repetitive and dull, especially during Boss fights.  One tip I'd have for you if you plan to play this game is to use a controller. It doesn't matter what controller, as long as you don't use Keyboard + Mouse. This makes it WAY less confusing, especially since this game was made assuming the player is using a controller.",1,0

2347213,242700,Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition,I'm not a huge fan of fighting games but I definitely enjoyed the story. I cannot give a rating of online gameplay because I refuse to do multiplayer here. As others have said the super moves get a bit boring after using them a number of times but hey - still fun. I had a strong preference for Aquaman and Deathstroke.  All in all - worth the sale price for nonfighting game fans and I'm sure fighting fans would find a great bit of enjoyment in the game worth even the non-sale price.,1,0

2969634,25890,Hearts of Iron III,"Simply amazing.  Pros - You can play as any country, and swtich countires in a save. Battles are very interesting and everything you do can affect them. Many regions, too many! Large amount of technology to research. Large amount of units. A lot to do, Many things that can change the history of World War 2. A great World War 2 alternative history game!  Cons - Has some bugs and glitches that weren't fixed. Game crashes in some moments, especially when on fast game speed and a large country surrenders. Game sometimes randomly crashes. Cannot stop war in the middle, A pace treaty will reverse all lands conquered, meaning you cannot take parts of countires (unless included in the game, Like the occupation of Poland by SU and Germany)  Overall a must play game in my opinion!

5448661,426000,HunieCam Studio,"The main reason this game gets a lot of negative reviews is that is had the misfortune to be thought of as a successor to the popular dating sim game 'Huniepop'. This is not a continuation of that game, in fact a lot of the details about characters have been changed to make the game more appropriate. The game is simply set in the same universe with some of the same characters from Huniepop. It's a clicker management game, and as far as that genre goes - it's pretty good. It's not my preferred genre, but I still had some fun playing it and it took me a few tries to earn some of the trophies and achievements. The art is good and the girls are well designed. I recommend the game if you're interested in what it might offer - but keep in mind it's not Huniepop 2, it's a completely different type of game.",1,0

5134998,391540,Undertale,"Undertale.  I have nothing but praise for this game. It's fun, creative, emotional, moving, hilarious, and blew my expectations away. I've heard the hype, the praise and love this game has recieved, and yet only recently did I finally crack and decide to see it for myself. Now I can only think that the game is in all honesty underhyped. I wish I had gotten it sooner. I wish I had experienced this when everyone else had. I wish I had looked passed the pixel graphics, looked passed the bandwagon and just played the game.   Never has a game made me laugh, then a moment later have me borderlining on tears, only to have me laughing again in moments! The environments and music blend so seemlessly together, even with the limited pixel count, that it's so easy to forget that the world is remniscent of the early days of gaming. The music itself? So moved was I by its presence that I bought the soundtrack, and I was pleasently surprised to see the extended versions of the ingame tracks, as well as the in-game versions themselves. The gameplay itself was not what I expected. I suppose I expected a bit of JRPG, but it was nothing like that at all. Far more creative, far more fun, and a great deal more intense and frantic at times.   This is one of those games where the story, from begining to end, will stick with me. For how long I can only guess, but if ever I start to fade on the details, I know I'll be coming back to live it all again.",1,0

I'd get frustrated that the workers would cut down the trees that I built houses around and how my houses started looking cluttered the more I expanded to win the game.

1992360,234190,Receiver,"First review! I wanted it to be this game because I absolutely adore the concept and I feel it deserves more attention, so I will be biased in that regard. It's a long review, so here's the tl;dr: Amazing concept, very fun and satisfying (though also very limited) weapons, good gameplay, decent atmosphere, extreme difficulty, slightly buggy, very badly optimized, not worth $5, but if you like the concept and it's on sale, go for it.  Receiver is a roguelike FPS made for the 7-day FPS challenge, hence its very unpolished nature. Almost every surface lacks textures, and the simple geometry would look pretty awful if not for the fact that the moody lighting, suspenseful music, and backstory told through cassette tapes serve well to actually give the game a decent atmosphere.  It's not a game for impatient people; you really have to be willing to learn the controls and some room-clearing basics to be successful. Take it slow, check your corners, be ready to retreat, and always maintain situational awareness! That taser drone might be too far away to hear the beep...  The gunplay, which is the real focus here, is fantastic and truly unlike any other FPS out there. Almost every conceivable action relevant to handling a firearm is bound to a key, and every one is satisfying and rather tactile. Firing them, recoil feels less like an airsoft gun and more like the hunk of metal slinging lead through the sound barrier with explosions they should feel like. There's also an aiming mode that allows the gun to be moved within certain limits of your vision without changing your view, which I find feels more like actually aiming a gun. You can also adjust the distance the gun is held from your eye, from realistic to 'you won't be needing those contacts anymore'.  As other reviewers have stated, the levels are randomly generated, although I think it bears emphasizing here that the physical rooms and buildings are only about 4 or so large, 3-story premade structures which are randomly selected to be chained onto an overall one-dimensional level. Enemy numbers are random and enemy location is random among certain designated locations, although some rooms will always have only one type of enemy, and some rooms will always have none, which can cause the game to become somewhat predictable at a point.  There are two enemies: taser drones (really more like stun gun drones), and rotating, stationary turrets. There are no living enemies, and I personally feel their absence adds nicely to the atmosphere of the game. Both enemies emit a blue light used for targeting; this changes yellow when you are spotted (along with a nice, loud beep you will learn to fear) and red when attacking after about a second of delay. The turrets are immobile and fire bullets, while the drones will chase you down near-relentlessly with a terrifying electrical sound. Each enemy also has rather sophisticated subsystem damage; shooting the camera will blind them, shooting the ammunition box or electrical weapon will render them unable to attack, shooting the motor or propellers will stop them from moving, etc.   The performance of the game, however, is far less than stellar... On my system which can run Arma 3 decently, there are noticeable drops in fps, nearly to the point of freezing for a second on loading the next building when stepping through a doorway (keep in mind, this is a game with very basic graphics, rudimentary physics, a near-complete lack of textures and the most basic of model geometry). As the game progresses, previous rooms don't seem to be unloaded, and so long sessions through many buildings will cause stuttering and a steady decline in frames. It's a pretty severe hit on the playability of the game, which knocks this review down from being an outright recommendation (especially not at that price!).  If you like the concept and have been looking for what is essentially a gun simulator, get this; there's nothing else like it to my knowledge. If you want a challenging and rather unique roguelike shooter, this is for you. To someone looking for good story, graphics, or who took a look at the screenshots and thought 'pfft, even my computer could handle this', it's probably not a good choice.  =========================== Technical info / comments / nitpicks ===========================  I love guns, so I'm also going to provide some additional information for anyone else interested:  External ballistics are surprisingly well-done, and bullets have their own time of flight and are even capable of ricochet, and although drop does not seem to be simulated, it isn't necessary for the distances firefights occur within. Bullets leave the firearms at the muzzle instead of the sights, forcing one to compensate when going for precision shots. Slides of automatic pistols lock back on the follower of the magazines after firing the last round, causing the slide to realistically return to battery in the absence of a magazine. The 1911 realistically cannot 'restrike' on an empty chamber, and must be recocked either by working the action or pulling the hammer to dry fire (the Glock, sadly, is unrealistically modelled as fully double action and can restrike without recocking in any way). Both automatic pistols also allow press checking to verify a loaded chamber, and allow the slide to be manually locked back with the use of the slide stop. Model 10 also has double action firing delay.  There are currently 3 handguns in the game: an Auto-Ordnance M1911A1, a Glock 17 (most likely gen 1) with an FSSG select-fire sear, and a S&amp;W Model 10 w/a 5-inch barrel.   1911:  Provides controls for: Magazine release, slide stop, slide, trigger, safety, hammer  Nitpicks: The safety by its appearance would not be able to lock the slide, although it is correctly modelled as being able to when it is engaged, hammer can be lowered while slide is pulled back, pistol can be 'safely' placed into a dangerous condition by having a round chambered while the hammer is down, slide does not lock back far enough for slide stop to visually engage   Glock:  Provides controls for: Magazine release, slide stop, slide, trigger, fire selector  Nitpicks: Can restrike on empty chamber, the barrel clearly does not tilt to disengage from the slide when racking it, which can look strange since it is flush with the slide, like the 1911, the slide does not lock back far enough for the slide stop to visually engage   Note: both automatic handguns have a strange bug whereby a round can be 'caught' when a loaded magazine is inserted and then removed while the slide is locked back. This results in the strange situation of, after doing nothing but inserting a magazine and removing it, the slide being released, a round chambered from somewhere apparently glued to the frame in the magazine well just below the breech face, and the slide locking into battery with a hot chamber, ready to fire. And you thought magazine safeties were pointless! They can also spawn in this odd condition, meaning the sight of a locked-back slide with an empty chamber and no magazine on spawning in does NOT mean a clear pistol!   Model 10:  Provides controls for: Cylinder release, case extractor, hammer, trigger, cylinder (to spin it... lol)  Nitpicks: Cylinder can be spun while closed without touching the hammer or trigger (although this can just be chalked up to 'rule of cool'), casings can get stuck on trying to eject them which shouldn't be possible with a full-length extractor (in fact, even the model shows the case mouth completely clearing the cylinder), .38 special rounds seem to be more effective than 9mm or even .45 ACP used in the other handguns, though this could possibly be chalked up to balance reasons   If you're familiar with the operation of a 1911, Glock, or just about any revolver, once the buttons are learned, it is possible to perform many actions even faster than in real life. Just need practice!",1,0

3155826,266110,Tower of Guns,"I paid a pittance for Tower of Guns, it being packaged in with a humble bundle, but I've mostly enjoyed what I've played of it so far.   It's a very simple game. You enter the tower and advance upwards through 5 different stages. To progress, you hunt through a room for a door, shoot it to open it, and in a few rooms you'll find yourself facing down a boss. There are plenty of enemies, mostly stationary ones attached to the walls and ceilings, but a few mobile ones that usually come in swarms and tend to like getting in your face. It gets pretty crazy at times with the sheer amount of enemies and bullets, and some of the rooms are quite convoluted.   Interestingly, you don't need to kill all the enemies - or any enemies - to advance, but if you do, you'll level up your guns, gain health points, and perhaps pick up a few permanent boons like 'Increased Crit Chance' or 'Extra Jump'. If you flee through all the rooms and never stop to get these boosts, you'll have a very tough time past the first stage.  There aren't a very large variety of stages. I'll be generous and guess that there might be ten, but they don't all look massively different from one another. Some have more environmental hazards to avoid, and others feature more bounce pads in very tall rooms, but it doesn't make that much difference.   Tower of Guns suffers most by not giving you enough variety at the start. You have to unlock new guns and perks, and while this doesn't take too long, your basic loadout is a bit boring. Similarly, which powerups you get and when can have a huge effect on how far you get with any particular run. If the gods of RNG don't smile upon you, you might find it a bit of a grind trying to take down some of the bigger, tougher enemies with a peashooter. When you get some good luck, though, TOG really shines, with hectic combat, fluid movement, and decent (if slightly generic) graphics.  Defo worth a punt.",1,0

I'll have to finish it before I come close to saying anything like that. It's far from a terrible game though. While I haven't had much in the way of problems, it does seem like they could have had a cleaner release... if you're patient unlike me, you might want to wait a week to see how the patching goes to be safe. That said, they did get a Win 10 patch out the door before I started playing and that may have helped me alot. I did like it that they worked to get that out quickly.",1,1

2584667,248820,Risk of Rain,"Posted: 15 Nov, 2013 @ 4:23pm I love the graphics, the monster index where you can see really great art of what something are supposed to be in case you can't quite tell (which you won't since most of the foes are original), there's a large list of items you can unlock but quite a lot are already unlocked as you start. There's several very different characters with unique skills and attacks, some are range, some are melee, some charge up and so on. The game is very difficult and even if you unlock absolutely nothing it's so fun to play it again. Just don't wait around too much, every minute spent will make the foes tougher.  Posted: 23 March, 2015 @ 4:42pm  If you want to play it multiplayer, it's not worth buying because the multiplayer is a mess. If you want to play it alone, you'll have a great time.  The devs have given up on this game though, little has been added since the first release.  + Aesthetics + THE best soundtrack, composed by Chris Christadoulou + Wide variety of items that change the gameplay each playthrough + Replayability, unlock new items each game and have a new combination + Many characters to unlock, all having different powers and attacks + Multiplayer, adds so much more entertainment to the game  - Connecting with multiplayer partners is shoddy at best - Latest version is far buggier than the first released version of the game (since 2014)",1,0

Pros:  Easy to learn eidtor Submersive realistic inviroment Realistic bullet physics (Not moisture or wind speed, but you get my point) Mostly positive community welcoming to new players.  Cons:  Hard to learn (Impossible to master [Doubles as a pro!]) Not everything is equal. Patience. Usually. Low Framerate  End conclusion: I love this game. I've had over hundereds of hours and don't know how to do some things, or that some existed. This game is welcoming to people with patience and a love for Ultra-Reality (Mostly) simulators. Most gamemode are fair and balanced, and everyone can have fun. (KOTH and Wasteland are two of my favourites). This game can be a pain at times, but the end product is well worth the hard spots.

The answer.....is a gun, and if that don't work, use more guns.' Well let me tell you there are an absolute crap ton of guns, and grenades. 3.DOUBLE-FREAKING JUMPING, ohhh do I LOVE this feature. 4.LINES OUTSIDE OF COMBAT. I absolutely hated the fact that in BL2 you only ever heard your character speak during fights; in the prequel though, each character reacts differently to different things throughout the game, they actually seem kinda human for once. 5.The result of all these combined allows for one H#!! of a good time both for missions/story AND the killing of the enemies that gets you through to the end; hence my label for this reward 'cuz I regularly hear that line in my head....",1,0

The community for this game is small, but it's never too hard to find a game and play, and isn't to hard to get into mechanically.  There are no individual victories in Guns of Icarus, when you shoot another team airship out of the sky, it's because the sum of your crews abilities beat the sum of theirs, and poor communication and planning are particularly punished.

1779556,230190,War for the Overworld,"This game, an obvious copycat of Dungeon Keeper (and that's not a bad thing), is very much like a disorienting disco where too many hallucinogens have throttled the experience from the mundane to the overwhelming. It's not that this game is bad. Actually, if they corrected a few mistakes, this game could be very cool. Unfortunately, the couple of problems that this game has makes for a disorienting and annoying experience.   First, the color palette is inappropriate to the genre, and, additionally, it is distracting to they eye. Let's face it, dungeons are dark places that are lit by torches. Fluorescent greens, oranges, and yellows do not belong in dungeons, except in the rare circumstance where magic is present. Most of the time, dungeons are like dungeons. That is, they are cold, dark, and earthy. Just looking at this game for too long can burn your retinas. I advise against that.  Second, the camera control is very limited. I want to be able to get a greater view of the happenings in my dungeon, dammit. Making me stay stay close in scope in relation to the goings on in my dungeon makes me dissatisfied. I'm the CEO of the dungeon, right? Shouldn't I be able to see the greater picture?  Like I said. I don't think this is a bad game, but it lacks insight into the basic wants of the RTS gamer.",-1,0

5438690,423880,Carpe Diem,"  This is my first review of a game on Steam.  When I first launched Carpe Diem, I instantly recognized that this visual novel was built on RenPy, as I already have the latest version of RenPy installed on my laptop (a HP/Compaq 8510p running 64-bit Fedora Linux).  The game starts with a meeting of Jung and Ai at a park. Jung is a programmer by trade that is focused on his work (not unlike myself back in the 1990s when I was developing database applications for credit reporting customers). Ai is the person whom he was dating in the story. The name Ai is also an acronym for 'artificial intelligence', as we find out at the end of the story.  The intent of the story as described in the 'Background' is true to the description. Getting priorities straight goes a long way in real life, not just in the dating scenes in this game. For that, I would give this game an 'A' for the storyline and intent.  I loved the music the developers chose for this game, though I would have chosen different pieces for each of the three choices you get at the first menu. For example, I would have chosen for the mall scene a piece music that was commonly heard in shopping malls over the past 50 years.  Overall, I liked this game so much, it gives me an idea for a visual novel.  Overall Rating: 'A' ",1,0

1472453,222880,Insurgency,"A modernized Red Orchestra with smaller maps. Most of the maps are amazing. However the problem with the maps is that the community seems to vote for the same 3 or 4 maps so there isn't going to be a lot of map variety (or at least there isn't in my time of playing). The guns are great and are even better if you download an enhanced Insurgency sound pack. One or two shots and the enemy is down, you won't have to worry about wasting your ammo... unless you're on full auto, that sh*t is hard to control at med-long ranges. There aren't very many weapons to choose from however but I've heard from the developers that they're working on new weapons.  The community is... strange, to say the least. Haven't come across too many problems in regards to people mic spamming and trolling. A quick vote kick will change that even if you do come across a mic spammer.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters. It's slow paced, so don't go expecting to sprint around the map and spray the crap out of the enemy because you will die. It's easy to adjust to so don't let that 'slow paced tactical realism' description turn you away.   7.5/10",1,0

3193805,268500,XCOM 2,"There are many similiarities between the first and second game. I will go into the likes/dislikes/same  Same:  1)Issues of where you can shoot through walls still remains 2) There is a point in the game when your ship comes under attack. If you lose, you lose the game (like the first with the base) 3) There is a pivotal point where you stop advancing in XCOM1 and XCOM2. Which leads me to #4 4) Everything is linear. I liked the original series where you had many bases and you could lose them but still play on. Nothing really surprised me in this game. Give us more strategy. I want to defend multiple bases like the originals.  Likes: 1) The use of engineers is actually intuitive. You can allocate labor to certain tasks. Scientists help speed up research 2) The new classes are pretty cool. 3) Covert opps/sabotages are cool 4) Snipers have been nerfed compared to xcom1 but are still pretty good 5) The aliens can call in reinforcement.  Dislikes: 1) Did I miss the mech parts of this game? I mean those were pretty cool in XCOM, why remove them? Maybe I just missed this (although I did beat the game) 2) Again it is very linear......kind of predictable 3) No Thin Mans? Those guys were awesome 4) Made it to the final stage without developing a psychic guy.  5) The weapons weren't as good. Man I miss blowing up everything with a rocket launcher......especially that blaster launcher. 6) Weird angles on the aliens' turns. You tend to miss a lot 7) Ugh I hate timed missions and this seems to have a lot of them. You only have X amount of turn to complete a mission.  Overall I enjoyed it. I beat it on normal mode. Now I will beat it on impossible.",1,0
4785175,366320,Seasons after Fall,"A huge, huge letdown. While Swing Swing's last puzzle installments weren't overly remarkable, they still offered a respectable challenge. Seasons after Fall disguises itself with a colorful world, but doesn't take advantage of its core 'season-changing' mechanic which ultimately diminishes what looks to be a blast to play.  The platforming is laughable and only serves as an instrument for the incredibly dull puzzles, if you can call them that. You could remove all of the platforming and replace it with the point and click nature of  Tetrobot and Co.  and you'd still have the same game, albeit without the frustratingly slow, clunky movement. Not to mention the obnoxious amount of backtracking or myriad of situations where a cutscene or completely unnecessary obstacle appears to merely waste your time.  Those moments where you see the Guardians? There aren't actually any epic moments such as those you'd find in Ori. Comparing the two is not dissimilar from that of apples to oranges. The story is shallow and the voice acting roles seem unfitting. The camera is almost exclusively fixed so there's no scope to be felt, it never opens up and reveals to you a great big world to explore. There's no magic here.  It sincerely feels like it could have used at least another 2 years in the cooker before it ever saw the light of day. The puzzles are not puzzles, it's the equivalent of playing connect the dots. All of the platforming was designed for a child and offers no engagement because it lacks any sort of extra movement or jumping mechanics a la wall jumps. The only redeeming factor is the art, and even then it becomes redundant an hour in due to the lack of variety.  Not worth spending time or money on, not even on sale. Avoid this game.",-1,0

1017788,214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"Awesome game! First and foremost, I love the different elements of the game. The story I wouldn't call the best, but it also isn't a bad story. I'm indifferent about the story, but the characters and how some of them are presented are pretty hilarious at times. I love how the game is presented with the game's artistic appearance and how each area can be swapped in and out going from the 'Land of the Dead' to the 'Land of the Living'. The Land of the Dead has a dark gloomy look. While the Land of the Living has this vibrant and cheerful look. Both of these have to be used through the game to get through certain areas. What may have been broken or destroyed in the living world, could still exist in the Land of the Dead. Which you can imagine how many different complexities this could add, and also how useful it could be. The music in this game is also a great addition. This game is very challenging at times, but you get a feeling of accomplishment after completing these areas. This game is a true platformer, one of the most difficult and challenging ones I've played in a while. It blends the elements of platforming and fighting into one game. The fighting actually has true fighting elements, such as combos. Some of these fighting moves can also be used as a platforming tool to reach different platforms. Which will be very useful during the game. The fighting for me is a big plus to this game. In many platformers, they lack good fighting mechanics. This game is a joy to play. I highly recommend it for any Platforming genre fan, or just a fan of good games.  9/10 Excellent!",1,0

2267303,240760,Wasteland 2,"I'm only a couple hours into gameplay but I'm already hooked. I wasn't sure if I'd like the gameplay because my experience is mostly with ARPG games like Diablo 3. My Fallout/Wasteland experience started with Fallout 3. I played every single expansion and had tons of hours of Xbox 360 time. I only recently got it for PC. So, i like the look and the story of the genre but would I like the gameplay? Once I took the time to learn it, and I'm still learning, I am really liking the team strategy. I'm no longer a single jack of all trades, my medic heals, my strong guy won't be using any computers but he can whack a raider. Anyway, this game is still in Beta and I held off playing until recently and I'm probably going to take another break. Nothing here so far looks incomplete maybe because it is all new. If you re the fence, I would recommending waiting. If you can't, it's still $60 but you get some extras. If those extras aren't enough, just wait. But once the game is released this August, it is going to be worth the wait. I'm looking forward to it. As always, I'll update this review as is play more!  Post release update. At $40, this is a game still worth the money but if you are still on the fence, it is sure to be on sale again. You still get hours of gameplay not to mention hours more when playing through again making different choices through the game. While I have no problems with the gameplay mechanic, the difficulty, I do wish the graphics were a little bit better. It isn't something that 'breaks' the game for me but every once and awhile, when I zoom in on a abandoned shell of a car, it would have been cool to see it in a little more detail. But of course, that isn't what this game is about. You will be reading in this game. A lot of reading and you would rather ignore the story and just whack enemies, go get Torchlight or even Grim Dawn. Not that they are bad games at all but with Wasteland 2 you need to pay attention to see where your next objective will be otherwise you could be stuck. The sense of accomplishment in figuring those out is really cool though.   I am not even to LA yet and I have no idea if I am even close. Anyway, we are about to have more and more 'classic' style RPG's hit the scene too. With the success of this game and Divinity: Original Sin, it will be interesting to compare the games to come, like  After Reset and Insomnia. In my opinion, the bar has been set high. This game isn't for everyone, and if the graphics were on par with some of the ARPG's, it might attract a few more gamers and in my opinion, raise the bar of all games out there as demand for the 'same old thing' just isn't good enough anymore. As always, I'll post updates as I progress.",1,0

The visuals and art direction of this game mold an extremely impressive aesthetic appeal, taking advantage of current generation technology and bringing new life into the classic tile based RPG genre.   The difficulty Legend of Grimrock presents is just right, not consisting of too much gauntlet difficulty while not being too easy. Legend of Grimrock 2 also features and impressive soundtrack and the audio is of high quality. The level design is non-linear and effective, making a fascinating world of many paths to explore.  As a massive fan of games like Stonekeep and Wizardry, this game delivers an enjoyable experience for hardcore tile based-RPG players while being accessible to new players of the genre at the same time. Being a game of such nature it requires an in-depth party creation, stats, items, spells and good level design to keep interesting, of which Grimrock 2 delivers superbly.  This is a gift to players who are nostalgic of the 90's era RPGs who want something of the same except current, and to new players who are willing to invest some time into a different kind of RPG experience.   Legend of Grimrock 2 is a revival done right and gives me hope of the future of indie games, this is trully an extremely high quality product with a lot of love and care put into making it. AAA games these days are getting shallower and more boring by the release so really nice to see a rare gem like this pop up every once in a while.",1,0

It no Alpha Centauri and its for sure no CIV VI!  Nevertheless it's a very well done spinoff of the Civ series like Colonization back in time.  Very well done but not pertfect, sure. But CIV V took 2 DLCs to be as complex and nice as it is now. CIV:BE has for sure as well room to improve, but as usuall this will come with DLCs.  In the state it is at the moment it's a very funny game - it's for sure not to hard like many people are saying. (C'mon - i played second game in highest difficulty and won) And last but not least it has plenty of innovations which bring a new way of playing it.   Whoever says the skill-net is too difficult to understand should perhaps try switch to LEGO or something.  The PROs:  + good Graphics for that kind of game + nice soundtrack - a few more titles would have been nice, though + nice new Science aproach, complex and dynamic + Affinities are a good way to modify the gameplay in a way it fits to the playstyle + nice new style-set + it's a CIV!   The Contras: - too dark in my oppinion - more different planets with graphic-sets etc would have been nice - AI is too simple. If you play focused and research some special technologies, AI has never a chance - even on highest difficulty. - Aliens should evolve throughout a game.  - Affinity should effect Alien behavior.  All in all it's a very playable and enjoyable game which for sure deserves no red reviews only because it's not an Alpha Centauri.   So long, have fun! Heady",1,0

614807,204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger," Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is a western first person shooter with an interesting way of storytelling; everything is told in a bar by Silas Greaves, and you relive his stories as he tells them to Ben, Jack, Steve and Dwight while having a beer at a saloon.   First off, yes, this is a ubisoft game and it doesn't have UPlay as a feature jammed up it's throat, let us rejoice!  I absolutely loved this game! Solid gunplay and nice mechanics that make it a bit more interesting, like some sort of 'focus' mode that let's you highlight and shoot the ever loving f*ck out of baddies.  The storytelling is definitely the strongest point of this game, you go along Silas' stories and meet interesting characters (that existed in the ACTUAL wild west) along the way. It's a very linear experience though, with little to no exploration or sidemissions in the storymode, sure there are the extra challenges that you can access in the main menu but those will give you 6 hours of extra playtime at most (or like 25 hours if you're a perfectionist like me). I did like the inclusion of 'New Game Plus' which let's you keep all your upgrades while starting a new storymode, which still made it worth replaying once or twice.  That brings me to another weakness of this game: you can play through the entire storymode in about 3 hours, so while it's a fun game to knock out in one sitting (believe me, I just did, for the 3rd time) It doesn't hold much replay value other than bragging rights for completing the game on all difficulties, which even at the highest difficulty level, isn't all that hard.  While it's a short and linear experience you find yourself shooting and blasting through, it does look pretty, with cell-shaded graphics giving it a borderlands-ish feeling which I definitely liked, you can even make your guns look prettier by upgrading your skills and you'll end up with beautifully engraved and gold-plated machines of DEATH!    TL;DR  +Good graphics +Good upgrade system (that let's you have nice and shiny weapons in the end) +Great gunplay +Interesting storyline +Outstanding presentation of said storyline +Interesting characters +NO UPLAY  -Quite linear -Not a lot of replay value -Really short (you can knock this game out in 3 hours or so) -Not difficult, even on the highest difficulty setting   Verdict:  Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a fun game, that is fun to play if you're looking for an easy, quick game to play, it's not gonna challenge you, test your abilities to the maximum but it's definitely a fun story-driven experience, no matter how short that is.

Now that the game its review lets talk about the community its a good one the market is fair but you will always have scammers so be careful look up prices. You can easily join a club and not to hard to make one. At the end of the day it can pay for the game or play it for weeks but if you can MMO's with action/skill combat this game will do not any Pvp (player vs Player) yet but maybe in the future.

856995,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"This is one of the most glorified games of these years because it's one of the 'hardest' game ever made.

At the beginning if you try to be a ♥♥♥♥ and start to kill NPC's, you'll be the one to get killed if you're not good enough (and the first time even the crestfallen warrior can put you down, and he doesn't look that strong), it requires some time to learn the mechanics but when you're into it you'll be satisfied: the combat system is nice as it lets you fight with weapons using parries, weak or heavy attacks and counterattacks, or attack on the distance with bow and arrow, magic and 'miracles', exploring areas rewards you but be careful about traps and if you don't build your character properly you'll be in serious trouble. The PC port isn't good so if you're planning to play this you'll need a controller and hope this game will work without problems.",1,0

577450,204060,Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP," This is a rather long review, so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to  Results  and read from there.   Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is clearly a tablet game; something that if you don't know before going in will really make you sour.    Story:  Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery is the story of a gender ambiguous character that embarks on a mission to bring peace to the land. An evil monster has arisen after the powerful tome was taken from its castle. As you progress through your epic quest you learn to realize how great a toll is put upon a true hero. The world twists and turns around you and the sounds of nature great a lullaby. You must fight to collect the trigons of power and assemble to force necessary to defeat the evil that has plagued the land.   Campaign:  The game is interesting and offers a mixture of sounds, visuals, and thoughts that create an absorbing atmosphere. The landscape repeats itself, as there are only about 20-25 different screens (this is a rough estimate). Some of these screens you only go to once, so realistically you run through the same 10-15 most of the time going backward and forward. You play as a character (of some gender) and go through their adventure defeating evil from the land; rather a basic adventurer’s tale is it not? But what really makes the story great is how the world unfolds in front of you drawing you in through the lore of the land. The tome which you find at the beginning allows you to read into the thoughts and feelings of those around you. Giving you a sense of understanding and wonder of how you are viewed by your friends, colleagues, and pet.    Gameplay:  The combat system is deficient as it is definitely optimized for two fingers. In order to initiate a “defend” or “attack” command you must move the cursor from one button on the screen to another and click. Moving the mouse and clicking the commands can be rather difficult in high stress boss fights. Most of the fights are simple and even the boss fights are not too tough, but when you lose against a boss you have to watch the fight animation all over again. It would be similar to watching Goku charge all the way to Super Sayan then the VHS losses track and you have to start all over again. The first time the charge up is awesome, but if you have to watch it two times in a row its infuriating. The soundtrack and imaginative story is what makes this game.    Quests:  The quests can be rather annoying, and a few times I had to look online for guides because the game wants you to click random patterns to solve a mystery without any hints on how the pattern would look. True I could have sat there for 20 minutes and figured it out, but that is just a waste of time.    Results:  Minus some of the elementary problems with the game, its interesting approach to a RPG/Arcade game. Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery pulls you through with a rather interesting story and mystical element that makes you wonder the whole time what will happen next. Pulling on your emotions and your curiosity this game is definitely an interesting and play-worthy game. Just make sure you understand when you get in that this game that it was designed as a tablet game. I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for a good price. I personally wouldn’t buy this unless it was 75% or more off. Waiting for a sale may seem frugal, but l on the itunes/play marketplace this game is $4.99, meaning that the $7.99 cost on Steam is way above what it should be.  Pros: +The soundtrack, the music really builds up the atmosphere of this game. +The story is at first a mystery that unravels to leave you wanting more. +Characters and environment really run together. +Its broken up into good length chapters. +Incorporation of character thoughts allows you to really delve into the stories of the people. +Not mentioned, but the dog which guides you through your adventure was a very good concept.   Cons: -Games playable areas are very few and overused. -Fighting is not designed for computers, and thus requires you to click buttons on a screen (when they could have easily incorporated two physical buttons in order to use the fighting commands). -There are very few settings and customization options. -Boss fights have way too long of animations.",1,0

To play this game online with a friend, you need a Facebook-profile to do so … in other words, if you don’t have a Facebook-profile, you are forced to open at Facebook-account in order to have fun coop-game with a friend.   So if you don’t have an account on Facebook, maybe because you don’t like the idea of having a facebook-profile, then DO NOT buy this game – otherwise you have spend money on nothing!  I do wonder why Kalypso have their games on Steam, when Kalypso don’t allow their games to run on Steams servers.   I like to have ONE account – ONE server to play my games by. I find it ridiculous to need several of servers to play my different games – and that is why I have a Steam-account – to play my online-games at ONE place!   I wish that Steam wouldn’t sell games which can’t be played on Steams own servers, because I don’t want to open all kinds of account everywhere. I want ONE account, ONE server from where I can play my games.   I hope that other whom read this will back me up and complain about this ridiculous policy to force us gamers to need many different servers and accounts (and now Facebook) to be able to play expensive purchased games bought on Steam.

525689,203140,Hitman: Absolution,"To say I haven't played this game for very long, i do think that its very good. In terms of how good the game looks and also how many different ways you can complete each level (overall gameplay). But i dont think that people shouldn't criticise this game purely because they like Hitman Blood Money more. In fairness Blood Money is an amazing game, in fact it is my favorite from the series. However, some people need to take into consideration the fact that all of the Hitman games are about carrying out assassinations and such. So to make another one that is this good is a hard thing to do. So if your open minded and have liked the other Hitman games i'd recomend this to you.",1,0

2879988,253130,,"Rescue - Everyday Heroes is basically a firefighting/paramedic game mashed up with a bit of Sims. There are a few bugs that keep it from being a great game, but if you don't mind them, go ahead and pick it up. It's fun despite the annoying bugs.  Graphics: Not bad. Not great. Just average. The one thing that did bug me was that if your mission occured during the night, it was near impossible to see your guys. Also if there was a lot of smoke, same issue. At least for the smoke the devs could have done the blue outline they used for the same guys and vehicles when they were behind a tree. Oversall, passable.  Audio: First up is the background music. All I have to say is that it didn't catch my attention, which means that it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. Sound effects were okay. Nothing really detracting, but the sfx of the fires crackling and the water running was nice. The vocals in the game are similar to what you would hear in an RTS. Click on a character and they respond with a 'Ready!'.  Gameplay: The game basically has two modes. The first is the prep mode. This is where you buy stuff for your firestation, hire units, buy vehicles, assign tasks, etc. Your units have traits, moods, and skills. Only thing is, nowhere does it say what the different things you buy do to affect your units mood. The traits are random and the skills can be leveled up to make your units stronger. I didn't really notice any difference betweena one chevron vs a three chevron unit.  The second part of the games consists of doing missions. These basically boil down to either stop a fire or save people. Sometimes missions require you to do both. The first few missions do a very good job of teaching you how to do these. By the final mission, you'll know exactly what you are doing and what you want your units to do.  Here lies the problem. It get be a pain getting your units to do what you want. Frist off is the pathfinding. Sometimes it's good. But most of the time you'll be wondering why your paramedic is going around the tree that's not in the way. Second is selecting your units. It can be a pain trying to click them. Especially when they are crowded together. You end up clicking the paramedic that's treating the victim and canceling the treatment instead of clicking the free paramedic that you want to go get the stretcher. There have also be times where I can't see my guys because when you put stuff away in the vechiles, they end up hiding behind the vehicle and you have to turn the camera which wastes time. Which brings about a couple more problems. Camera and time. The camera can only pan, rotate, and zoom. No tilt. Which means that if you are in the city, it might take you awhile to find a good vantage point between all the highrise towers. Also time. There's no way to slow down time so you can find your guys. Lose track of your paramedic or firefighter holding the special tool you need, and you're gonna waste time while the victim in the cars slowly dies. The devs should have added a feature to slow down time so you can give commands, or made it so you can still view the game while paused.  So in conclusion, the game is fun. There are bugs and poor design choices. However, if you are willing to overlook those, go ahead and get the game. It's short, about 4-5 hours of you time. I recommend getting it on sale.",1,0

4231967,324800,Shadow Warrior 2,"A 2016 masterpiece. This is one of the most fun and addictive games I played in the last few years. Beautiful graphics and frenetic gameplay makes this one of my favourite games. The game plays like shadow warrior 2013, but now the maps are open, not so linear like the former ones. You can play side missions, progress the story or just free roam through the maps of already completed missions. You can play like the old shadow warrior too, just follow the minimap trail putting bullets (or cuts) on everything that moves. The game has an interesting mechanic much like RPGs: you find new weapons and every weapons has 3 slots in it. In those slots you put gems that you find during the missions gameplay. The game features a selectable difficulty much like Diablo's, so you can replay it a lot and continue to develop your character. To those people complaining that you have to think and build weapons and skills, you can just turn down the difficulty and just pass through the levels killing the enemies like you used to in SW2013. One of the biggest pros of this game is that you can customize you difficulty, weapons, skills to fit your gameplay as you like. Finally, it doesn't make any sense to not recommend this game just because it isn't exactly equal SW2013, you can play the game almost like the old one (except for the premade maps, which now are procedurally generated) and the game is very, very, very  excellent  by itself.",1,0

5820516,493450,Wild Romance,"Ok, so after having played this versoin and the Japanese original version next to each other, I have to say... this is terrible. They have cut out loads and loads of lines, that are NOT linked to H-scenes. (The H-scenes are gone from this release, and that is fine I guess. It is a steam release after all.) BUT, I have spent about 2 hours comparing the general conversations and lines in the Japanese to the English version, and they have literally removed a good portion of them, for absolutely no reason, expcet lazyness. These conversations are not crude or offensive, so removing them is utterly pointless, and in fact removes some of the depth from the game. (Instead of seeing the full conversations in the game, you are seeing like 60% of them in this release. It is confusing and very, very strange. You actually don't see everything how it was intended, meaning you are missing out on certain things that existed in the original, even non H-related talk.)   If you are considering buying this, at least keep in mind that the game is not complete. It is actually lacking about 50% of its original content. (Most of that % lies in the H-scenes, but some % also lies in missing dialogue, which is unrelated to H-scenes.)  Another strange thing they have done is put in 'narrator' as if that is a person speaking in the game. The narration in this game is done by the main character, and it is his thoughts in the first person that is the narration, like you see in most visual novels. But, in this translated version, they have added in 'narrator' as a 'person', which is inconsistent with the original. (You still see that the lines are coming from the main character, as he uses 'I am', 'I think' and so on, but for some reason, they keep the 'narrator' badge on every single narration line regardless. This is very confusing.)   There is also one last thing that confused me greatly in this game. It seems like they cannot decide what they should and should not leave in the game. They have left in almost fully nude sprites, with just tiny rays of light covering the nipples, (usually I would think this is a good thing, because it is very minimal censorship,) but then at the same time, they have literally cut out innocent parts of dialogue, that just casually mentions genitals, boners, or even just hints to the fact that sex occured. But they don't cut it ALL out, just most of it, so you'll still see hints of that in the game. It is like they can't decide among themselves what level of censorship they should go with, and the result is a very, very bad release.  The translation itself is okay. It is very literal, and a bit strange at times, (certain speech patterns and easy to translate Japanese phrases are TLed very... strangely, but the TL quality overall is definitely not bad.)  They have left in most of the 'normal' CGs, fairly unaltered from what I can see, but over 50% of the cg gallery, which contains H-scenes, is missing. (This was to be expected, as it is an all-ages release, but keep that in mind if you are considering buying this.)  In conclusion, the biggest flaw in this release is the very, very awkward and inconsistent censorship, as well as the actual removal of important, and not H related dialogue. Overall, buying this is not worth it in my opinion. Don't give these people money for such a lazy job.",-1,1

5017908,385260,Lamia Must Die,"Exactly what it says on the tin. 20 minutes of JRPG from start to end credits. Some setup, some voiced dialogue (Charming amateur work.), some nice art, and one boss fight. It's all quite easy.  Just turn off active time battle. You don't know these characters so you'll have to check their skills.  You can change two party members, so you might want to replay to see what different plot there is.  Still, the whole thing is incredibly trivial. A lot of effort went into the art, voice work, etc, and everything is certainly workmanlike, but there's nothing all that interesting here. Fun enough for a freebie though.  In reflection, though, I think that is actually something profound. Look how rare it is for a game to have the monster ACTUALLY BE A MONSTER that must die. How rare it is for the heroes to actually save the day from a monster. There's no twist where you were the monster all along. No stupid navel gazing about two so gray so grimdark factions and having to pick blah blah.

229253,110800,L.A. Noire,"Alot more hours than I thought were put into finishing this game. I'll have to say first that it is one of the best examples of storytelling in gaming that I've seen in awhile. There are certainly one-dimensional characters that pepper the landscape throughout, but a decent attempt is made to delve into the primary characters. Graphics were superb, the lifelikeness of people was really well done. 1940s LA is a sprawling landscape, however not as...interactive as a GTA type game might be.   The interface was easy to use, whether walking, driving or investigating.   I was somewhat put off with the resolution of the game initially, but then realized how much it fit with the whole theme.   Interrogation was not my strong suit and I found myself repeating parts several times to really figure out clues to their full extent.  Game length was not an issue....the story kept it from becoming too repetitive over time, but then again, I guess the job of being a detective can get to a point where it feels like that. Solve one crime, another pops up.",1,0
568939,203770,Crusader Kings II,"This game is bloody awesome. Sure, it's arguable that the learning curve is steep, but it's all worth it once you get into the meat of the game. Without DLC or mods, you can play as any medieval lord, from a minor earl in Scotland to the ruler of the Byzantine Empire, starting at any point in time between 1066 and sometime around the 1300s. From your starting character, though, things can generally get historically inaccurate, based upon the decisions that you make, meaning that you're not limited to history and can do just about anything.  And then, if you decide to get DLC (but still stick with no mods) you can play as a Mongol lord, Charlemagne or the emperor of India. You can get access to every religion, including paganism, islam and hinduism, you can start as early as the 700s and the map goes from Iceland to Sri Lanka, with practically everything in between.  Essentially, this game is well worth the forty bucks.",1,0

4148865,321960,Might & Magic Heroes VII ,"There is no denying of a disastrous launch, the game was buggy and practically unplayable for significant portion of people. However, the patch 1.2 and 1.3 has turned the situation around magically.  I started playing HoMM2 in 1997, and has been playing each installment ever since. I am happy to say the current incarnation of HoMM7 is a worthy successor.  In term of the game play itself, HoMM reached its height at HoMM3 and more or less plateaued from there on. There are additions and reductions in each installments since then, but core functions are about the same. HoMM7 is no different.   The major improvement, AFAIK, is the graphic. UE3 is a popular engine and is behind many major titles in the past 5 years. It is NOT outdated, as most UE4 games won't be out until 2016.   There are still improvement to be made for sure. Improve AI, improve multi-player, improve map editor's performance, etc. All of those will determine if the game has long-lasting values after all campaign and customize maps are done. But for now, the game offers 100+ hr of fun play time in a beautiful world, and thats nothing to be sneezed at.",1,1
6367327,91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,"E.Y.E is a bit weird at first, given the setting. On top of that, most characters do speak russian. But it's wonderful refreshing to the 5th sequel of a well known franchise or to the 10th clone of it. The story unfolds nicely, and opens up to multiple endings.  E.Y.E may not have next-gen graphics (in fact it's Source engine, like HL2, TF2 etc.), and it's flawed and unpolished. But you get to play it the way you want, be it armed to the teeth with deadly weapons and heavy armor, a more careful approach employing sniper rifles, or you might want to hack the enemy, so you achieve your goals without getting dirty yourself.  Also, it has coop, which is eespecially interesting given that you can split the roles, so e.g. one concentrates on hacking, the other waltzes around, mowing everything down.  If you don't mind having to put up with some of the games quirks, you should give it a shot.",1,0

I'm still not sure how all of the loot/freestyle/toy functions work. On the court, I found rebounding and using your special moves to be difficult.

Pros: - Extremely fun and tough arena dogfights - Nice graphics that really add to the nice speed feel - Great variety of playmodes  Cons: - THE GAME IS DEAD. When I played today, only 1 Server was populated. Being owned by highlevels while you practice to fly is just frustrating. You don't even know what hit you. - No unlock system, everything seems to be avaiable from start... so no long-term motivation. - No real Input support but Mouse+Keys... Seriously, a jetfight game with Mouse+Keys?!?! So hard to do anything controlled. - The Radar just sucks. It is just irritating. - No real tutorial, just Soloplay Challenge modes in which you fail miserably.  I probably won't touch this game again.

3222023,270010,Time Rifters,"I played this game on a PC with a usual monitor, without DK2. This game is good for VR but bad for a desktop PC. As a non-DK2 owner I can only give it a thumbs down. Maybe the devs should have just waited for the Oculus Rift to come out and publish the game then. On Steam and desktop this game is somewhat out of place.  It's like a shooting range, where you shoot at moving cubes and run around a small area for a better shot angle. The innovative part is that you do this 4 times per level, and each time you do this you are recorded, so next time you will see your own copies doing what you did last time. With the efforts of all your doubles combined, it plays like a co-op game. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is for a short time, just don't expect too much.  Usually you will shoot a portion of the enemies in one run, another portion in the second run etc. Or, since it's all pretty casual and you won't plan much, you will just shoot what you can in the first run, then, recalling what you had difficulties with (like the tough yellow cubes), you focus on those in the next runs, maybe also guessing which weapon will be best for the situation. You also run around collecting loot (small dots which make a typical 'score' sound reminding Mario-like 2D platformers). For the coins you buy straightforward upgrades for the weapons (more damage, faster firing, more spread, faster rockets etc). The game feels like an attraction in a theme park where you compete with other visitors to win a teddy bear for your girlfriend.  There is even a level designer but it's awkward to use on a PC since it's obviously made for people wearing a VR headset and struggling with its limitations. The graphics are bright and feel casual. The music is disco-style; it's good but somehow it adds to the game's shallow feel. The levels are pretty varied, struggling to postpone the rising boredom. You may want to play it 15-20 minutes in a session when you are waiting for something - much like a mobile/flash game.",-1,0
3331784,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Fantastic environments but the monsters are to klunky, or the controls are, appear to be way handicapped and far to easy to find and hold, basically just run after the footprints.

Another poster basically summed it up big ♥♥♥ arms with tiny little hits cuz It's hard enough hitting four little hunters buzzing about. Three stars out of 5. Get it on sale for some cheap fun, but wait till the monsters get a buff or something for full price. The monsters should be monsters and the hunters should have to plan wisely to get them, not just run in circles chasing (the M cant hide, just sneak which is basically useless). The game will also kick you out in the middle of a match for some reason as well, seems to be happeneing more and more frequently even though there are hardly any players online.  The hunters are fun to play with plenty of variety but the monstera are super dissapointing.  There also appears to be a glitch with the collision in game because sometimes you will kill a creature to feed but it will fall through the ground, time waisted during a chase.",1,0

5501739,429580,A Wild Catgirl Appears!," My full review can be found here.  [www.the-backlog.net]   A Wild Catgirl Appears! follows the story of high schooler Ami as she is forced to join a club. While creating a game featuring a ninja catgirl, the catgirl figure (basically an Amiibo) comes to life and starts living with her. You'll be able to go down one of four romance paths in this fairly short visual novel.  A Wild Catgirl Appears! features some of the most clashing art I've ever seen. Some CG images are very clearly done by two different artists, often with parts of their 'regular' model pasted onto the body of some MS Paint drawing. The internal resolution also seems to be no where near what the resolutions you can set the game at, causing a lot of pixelation in both the images and the menus.  There's not much notable about the story besides there suddenly just being catgirls. You can't scroll back through the dialogue at all either, as A Wild Catgirl Appears! lacks certain basic functions every other VN I've read has had - a backlog. There's also no way to fast forward through previously read text, meaning if you want to get all the paths, you'll have to click through it manually.  There's not much in the way to really recommend about this game. There are much better VN's out there. So save your money and just look elsewhere, even if you are into the whole catgirl thing.",-1,0

It's somewhat realistic when it comes to hunting and it really keeps you on the hunt. It has some issues and here they are: Free to play allows you to hunt 2 animals, one of whitch you don't have a the right weapon.  It can be confusing in the beginning that there are many other animals in the area that you can't hunt. You can earn in-game currency but it's way to much work to earn any weapons or licenses for free.  If you pay for a license or starter pack, it will last 3 months and you get 2 guns.  If you whish to go straight into hunting bigger pray you need to start pouring allot of monney into this game.  You would pay for this game but it's too big of a leap money wise to go all the way, but if you do so then I think the features of gameplay and different types of hunting and gear will be a allot of fun.

The game feels very fair. Even the achievements are fun: they reward you for thinking 'outside the box' and trying to use items in clever ways.  People here complain that they were duped into thinking that this was a 'complete' game not just the first part of a series. I have to agree that the messaging is inadequate and the devs should do a better job at clarifying this up front. That said, this first episode is 'complete' in its own sense, and offers a certain sense of closure. I played the game without knowing that it was just 'part one' but did not feel cheated at all. Instead, I am excited about what will come next! You get a lot of answers in the end, but not all of them. I see no problem with that.  So many games have sequels!

The only thing that was kind of disappointing was the length, but I think it's a good buy during a sale. And by the way, did I mention the mother is a badger?

794566,209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Don't get me wrong, I love batman games, but this one just felt insanely cheap. Combat is exactly the same except for an extremely overpowered powerup you get about halfway through the game, which completely destroys the purpose of special enemies.  As far as the main story goes, it took me just under 10 hours to complete, and felt insanely boring the whole way through. The whole way through this just felt like an arkham city DLC, with the only difference being slightly better graphics and different enemies. The side missions aren't very exciting at all and the collectibles are just too boring to collect (coming from someone who collected every single riddler trophy and riddle in arkham city) and are not rewarding at all. This game is not worth the full price, and you shouldn't play this with very high expectations.",-1,1

797436,209080,Guns of Icarus Online,"This is probably one of the most satisfying games I've played in a long time. Nothing is better than being in a crew that can work well together and mow down anything that comes within firing range.  Overview:  Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunky deathmatch multiplayer game where teams of 2 or 3 airships, each maned by crews of 4, fight it out on various landscapes. You can choose between 3 classes: a pilot, gunner or engineer, each with roles necessary to keep your ship from being a scortched pile on the ground. The beauty with the classes is that no one class is 'better' than another, you play whatever role suits you the most at whatever time.  Classes:  The pilot is the head of the ship, generally the one to call the shots and make up the strategies while maneuvering the ship to get out of danger or to line up the guns. I personally don't have a lot of experience with this class because I'm terrible at piloting but the controls for the ship aren't that difficult, it takes a little getting used to but the training match will help you with that.  The gunner does exactly what you think they do, puts big holes into peoples ships with different ammo. You can make yourself very familiar with the different weapons and ammunition by looking at the ship customizations as they all have easy to understand statistics and by testing them out in the training.  The engineer is the poor bugger stuck with keeping things from breaking and catching fire when the pilot screws up. All jokes aside, as the engineer your job is the keep everything on the ship running and in good condition. It's a very daunting task at first because the ships have so many components to keep track of but the game has a very good interface that shows the durability/status of each component at all times on your screen. It helps to know the layout of your ship so you know where to run when you see that fire symbol flashing on your balloon. Personally I find the engineer to be the most rewarding class even though you don't always get the praise for keeping the ship up.  Loadouts:  You can customize your loadouts for each character to provide for various needs on the ship. The loadouts are split between gunner (ammunitions), engineering (repair tools) and piloting (mobility modifiers) slots. Each class has one slot in the group they're not in and multiple in their own (for example, engineers have 1 gunner, 1 pilot and 3 engineer slots). You can coordinate with your crew to create loadouts that best fit your strategy.  Maps:  There are a good variety of maps, each with their hazards and strategies involved. Some may have dust storms which conceal your ship but damage the engines while others can have hard to navigate terrains with good ambushing opprotunities. They are diverse enough to not feel like the same map over and over again but not over the top to feel like they're out of place. They're all a good size and feel very creative in their design.  Ships:  You can take your pick from 7 ships , each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Each ship can be customized by giving them custom names, aesthetic changes if you unlock them and you can choose the guns that go on the available slots. Depending on the ship and gun location you can have light or heavy weapons, each weapon is more effective against certain ship components and have specific ammo properties (such as explosive, fletchette, piercing etc.) The ships do feel very balanced especially when piloted by the right crews so there's nothing that feels OP or unbalanced to go up against. A death generally feels like it's the fault of the crew instead a fault in the balancing.  Coop:  What really makes this game special is the cooperation within your crew and your team. The creators have made it very easy to coordinate with your crew and team by having chat options split between crew, team and global (with text and voice) all accessed by the touch of one key. The game is held together by the premise of working as a team, each crew member needs to pull their weight and communicate well to work at full potential.  Cons:  -I've had some performance issues especially when everything is on fire at once, the most recent patch has definitely helped with that but keep in mind you might get some lag when the flamethrowers light you up. -It can be a bit overwhelming at first since there are so many ships with so many weapons with so many stats and so many loadout choices. Start out small and get a feel for the game and it's mechanic and you'll be fine.  I definitely recommend this game especially since it's on sale right now. I'd be honoured to try to put out the infinite fires on your ship!",1,0

4367885,335000,Tormentum - Dark Sorrow,"Good things about the game:  ++ Awesome art. Really, every single scene and character in the game is painted beautifully and with so much detail. Every screen is a feast for the eyes in some way, with its own dark, twisted world. Imagine someone like Geiger doing a video game. This game is proof that we do not need to be stuck in pixellated art for adventure games. + Atmosphere: the feeling of oppression, mortal frailty and fatality of the world comes across well. Everything attaches itself well thematically to what is going on and almost every little thing has some dark twist about it.  + If you are afraid of the incredibly obtuse puzzles, you have nothing to fear in this game. Despite the twisted nature of the world, the puzzles are logical and the game isn't afraid to give you open hints as to what you need to do.  + Different environments: again, every screen looks and feels different. Are are unlikely to see the same wall twice and the game does everything to vary the nature of the environment. The environments are actively part of the story rather than lazily copy-pasted all over.  + The story had a surprising twist-ending (well, it surprised me).   Bad things about the game: - The puzzles will not be challanging to a veteran adventure gamer. There are one or two puzzles where you can figure things out without the game giving you a solution but that's about it. However, the game still holds interest to them for its art and atmosphere.  - Not enough oppressing/depressing music! I recall only one instance in the game where the music actively contributed to the scene. Otherwise it is fairly muted or I don't recall it at all.  - The story does have you start with amnesia but for one driving memory. However, the character's identity is not imporant to the plot (until the end) and the story actively works with this rather than just use it out of laziness.  - The game has a moral choice system but it is rather transparent and predictable where it goes. It falls into the trap of 'doing evil for evil's sake' and rarely really tempted to do evil. Evil needs to be something that the player would chose from something other than sadism (or amoral selfishness) and good needs to be the hard, unrewarding thing to do or even something you wouldn't think to do.  - I don't really call it a negative but the game has no hint system or even a point-of-interest highlighter. The game is design well enough that you don't need them.",1,0

4900293,377160,Fallout 4,"I tried so hard to like this game. I am a massive Fallout fan. I have played every game in the franchise, and I loved every moment of them.  First of all, there are good parts of this game, it's just hidden behind a massive pile of ♥♥♥♥. It's buggy, but you knew that already. The biggest problem came from the fact that everything that made me ignore the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the previous games are gone. There are no RPG elements left. There are few interesting conversations. Terrible writing. Everyone just accepts you as their lord and saviour without meaning, and expects you to give a ♥♥♥♥. Nobody gives you a reason. No one has any personality. And nothing makes any god damn sense. It's all so washed out and feels like an Early Access Indie game. They just through every single thing they can think of, and hope that something sticks.  The very worst part is when I think back to my 30+ hours of playing this game. From Fallout 3 I remember every detail of every quest, because they were unique, had charm, carisma, laughter. I remember finding a violin in a fault to get a new radio channel. I remember finding Little Lamplight, the little town with only kids, where they get exiled when they grow up. The virtual reality, dropping the nuke on megaton. There were so many amazing moments that will stay in my memory until the day I die.  In this game I think I remember som part of saving a private detective? But he got stuck in the wall so I had to reload 30 minutes of progress. Pretty much the time I stopped playing the game.",-1,0

Far too long cutscenes coupled with too many instances of forced camera angles and abuse of quick-time events (press *this* button now to do something) often make it feel like a bad mash-up of an interactive movie and an action Tap-Tap-Revenge.  It's a pity, because the game is otherwise fun to play, has loads of things to discover, and the skills/gear updates make the gameplay more interesting as you progress. I wish quick-time events were restricted to 'trick' moves such as the stuns/finishers after dodging an enemy - that's a place where they truly shine.  Despite my low score, I'm still recommending it, especially if you can get it at a low price (I got it as part of the Square Enix Humble Bundle).",1,0

This breaks the immersion that the game tried to make.  Hacking isn't really hacking but a form of repetitive 'guessing puzzles'. Like one of the easiest 'locks' to break just needs you to type something like lock:'unlock'. It gets old real quick.  When you break a server you usually just get a bunch of credits.

Anno 2205 sure was a Hit ... both in the Literal and Figurative sense in both Negative and Prosive. It definetly had some Potential and was infact a good game (Still is actualy) so call up to you: Comunity. Dont be Afaid there are worse games out there and this game may have/had a bad time but we all know that if we dont have fun ... we do something wrong. So I Call Upon you and Give this Game another Chance by ignoreing the fairly Ripoffy thing with the DLC wich may already have been fixed in the Future.    So now thats out of the way i may say something about the game ...  The Graphics are Good, very good. And the Gameplay is nice and Smooth.  It surely is diffirent from what we are used from Modern gameing but i still say this:  Give it a Try, there are Worse games out there and if you look at the play time of others. You'll see that i am correct when saying that this game is fun and still stays mostly true of the Anno Concept of Building and Advanceing your 'Empire'. Thats all i have to say.",1,1

3548513,288160,The Room,"The Room is a puzzle game with a focus and atmosphere that is outright missing in most other similar games in the genre but would feel right at home in a creepy horror or possibly supernatural mystery game. The intricate designs and wonderful yet subtle music only adds to the gameplay where you, as the player, can immerse yourself in trying out various solutions, knocking on wooden panels, feeling brass filigreed overlays, and rotating slightly oily steel gears to figure out the puzzle boxes you encounter.  The additional gimmick of the Lens adds a very different, almost creepy, vibe where you are peering into another world, one not quite visible to the stunted human senses and needing aid to see what is really there. The overall game is somewhat short and ripe for expansion. The puzzles are lengthy and can be obscure but you're left with an accomplished feeling (turn off the hints!) and a genuine curiousity to see the wonders that are in the next Room. Thankfully there is little frustration for the patient and the solutions aren't unfair - just concealed.  Wholeheartedly recommended for any puzzler and for those who want a nice layer of spooky atmosphere to compliment it.",1,0

5594184,443980,Burokku Girls,"Burokku Girls is the latest game from Silver Cow Studios, who previously developed Time Tenshi, another similar VN. This confuses me, since Time Tenshi's cliffhanger ending still hasn't been resolved with the sequel yet, but what can you do, right? If you haven't played Time Tenshi, the basic gist of these games is a focus on a deep 'plot' and 'well-developed' characters, by which I mean 'great big gazongas'. The actual storylines aren't bad, but at times they feel like more of a conveyor belt for floppy funbags, and it's safe to say that if you're not buying it for the sweater puppies you might want to look elsewhere. I didn't really like the story of Burokku Girls as much as I did Time Tenshi, but it was still decent outside of the occasional moment where it fell too deep into anime cliche. This game is notably darker than Time Tenshi, however, which might be off-putting for people just looking for a good wank. But the real question is, does it end on a cliffhanger like Time Tenshi?

6103621,57690,Tropico 4,"I felt from the very beginning I played this game this one was good. However other people don't think that way:   ''I don't like it. Its a rubish game''- Said me a friend.  I like it but that doesn't mean you will like it. I enjoy it 'cause I play meanwhile i'm watching a film or speaking with friends by any software or doing whatever. That's because this game is a bit slow. For example, you need X $ to build something. If you don't have that money you won't build it and that's why you must wait and since waiting isn't funny doing another thing wil keep you enjoyed the time you are waiting.   Apart from that problem I can't say anything more bad about this gem. ITs a really funny game with lot of action and interesting things. All levels are difficult and you must thing whats the best way to be rich in all of them.   So coming again to the question if I'd recommend it: I will to those people who likes doing 2 things at once and to those who like calm games of building a city.

4668728,359320,Elite Dangerous,"Finally got round to installing Elite via Steam. I have been playing on and off since Beta (2014). Long story short the technical aspects of this game are great, the graphics and sound are excellent, and the flight model is good (although not very realistic). Sadly the gameplay is not remotely at the same level, and everything you do is easy and tedious once you have learnt the basics. There is little depth to anything you can do, and few ways to interact with the galaxy around you. I have been hoping since launch that the devs would focus on gameplay once they got the basics sorted, but this does not seem to be happening.  Possibly the worst part of the game though is that there is no variation in the galaxy. No matter where you go in the human occupied areas of space everything is the same, there are no dangerous places or safe places, just a little notice on system security level in your map, which might be completely different one hop further along your route. You can't really tell if you are in a system that is in a state of civil war or one that is in economic boom before you land at the station and check the message board.  A game that could have been great but is instead just mediocre. Worth a try, but don't expect too much.  Pro's: Great recreation of our galaxy Good graphics Great sound Fun to fly around, fun to land in space stations and planetary bases  Con's: Very simple gameplay No depth to your choices, no tactics All gameplay revolves around grinding, nothing is difficult, just timeconsuming - Grind deliveries for powerplay - Grind simple fetch quests for engineers (scanning wakes, searching for rocks on planets) - Grind trade routes or long range missions for cash  In summary: A game that started out well, and then lost its way through updates that lacked any sense of direction or purpose, and just added gameplay for the sake of it. Unless they pull out something amazing for Season 3 (or even just focus on improving the core game) then Elite is dead.",-1,0

644974,205100,Dishonored,"Well. First off may I state that this was not what I had in mind when I purchased it. However, I don't mean that in a bad sense. While the gameplay may seem repetitive, it's the little things that really make this game as good as it is. Each level offers at least two or three different paths to get to your targets, which adds to the replay value more than I originally thought it would. In case it matters, this is one of those games where your actions lead to different outcomes. There are often multiple ways to achieve the ending you want. Overall, the story was thoughtfully pieced together, and again, the detail work really adds value and appreciation to the game. As for the characters, their personalities aren't really fully developed, and the dialogue doesn't add a whole lot either, but I was surprised when, right off the bat, I felt a strong emotional connection to each the major characters - pity, rage, suspicion, and affection for most of the cast, and what I can only name as a kind of deep understanding for the ones I expected to hate with all my soul.  Because there is so much that pulled me in emotionally, I have the pleasure to say that this is the only game I have finished in a single day. Playing this game was less like entertainment and more like living through a story in the best way possible.  Come for the assassinations, stay for the experience.",1,0
2181826,239030,"Papers, Please","This game is hilarious, creepy, repetitive, and engaging all at the same time. While its concept of accepting or denying people the right to entire a country may seem boring, or even idiotic to put into a video game, it works! The campaign focuses on paying close attention to detail so you don't earn penalties by admitting fraudulent people, all the while you get paid based on people let in and you're on a timer. Your family and yourself can all die of mutliple causes, and the game ends automatically if you run into debt. Everything is expensive, and the pay is little. The other gamemode, Endless, allows you to repeatedly play the game based on a few parameters, depending on the sub-gamemode that you choose. While the game may get frustrating at times, the frustration has a flappy bird effect, where it just keeps drawing you in to play more. For just $10, this game is a steal.",1,0

As i read on the internet people could fly around in their other dog fighters in the previous series of the X-game but even when i was stuck with one ship it was still really good, the game itself i think myself it was really solid and a fair game but early in its release days i almost would have much more fun waiting for a blue screen to pop up i just can't imagine those horrible moments i had back in the days with bad performences and almost no missions to no capship management i feel there is a lot better performence and management right now but it feels still a little bad around dogfighters and targeting things individually with a dialog to follow and a dialog to attack from each individial dogfighters was kinda hard to do without losing alot but hey, it learned me patience and better targeting by time.  If the game had a little better release and such i believe it would never sit at mostly negative but more like mostly positive but i honestly think this game really is a good game if you got alot of time on your hand and patience to do stuff, the campaign is really good as well but it can feel weird for a first time.",1,0
3341599,274480,Drox Operative,"I had a tough time really staying motivated with this game. Though I put in a decent amount of playtime, I didn't really feel that I'd accomplished all that much, and I didn't feel like pushing forwards. A friend and I played a handful of games, and ended up getting meeting three of the win conditions. The other win conditions seemed to involve a bit more luck, and seemed to drag on and on. In my view, although these games are procedurally-generated, the variables don't seem to produce anything particularly interesting. The best part of the game, in my view, is the way that your ship is constructed. Your 'build' consists (for the most part) of which parts you install on your ship. If you want to be more tanky, put on more armor at the cost of firepower/thrusters/power. If you want to maximize DPS, throw on a second weapon. However, it's difficult to really feel that you've maximized your spots, and it's hard to plan when you really don't quite know what you'll find. However, I understand that planning in an action-RPG is not something that everyone is interested in doing. However, I like to do it in every one, to know where all my skills points (etc) are going. One quick fix that might improve my experience would be an outline of which types of parts can go into which slots. Is it possible to find a weapon in the green slot? Are there any super-powerful red crew members?",-1,0

You will not be provided an end game goal with a clear cut step by step path on how to achieve it, because it doesn't exist. You are on your own in neutral standing with nothing but your Sidewinder and 1,000cr. It's up to you to decide what you'll make of yourself. It's up to you and you alone to decide where you will go and who you will become. Will you prey upon people or defend them? Nothing is given to you after your Sidewinder and 1,000cr. You must earn what you want through trial and error. You will become frustrated and you will die, but you will learn.    It took me about a day and a half to travel 220LY. I travelled that while flagged as hostile because I joined a distant faction. My 'mistake' forced me to learn how to evade interdiction, what stars I could scoop fuel from, and what systems I could find some measure of respite in. If I ever want my Sidewinder back I'll have to travel back to Frey which is in hostile territory, another lesson learned. Within 3 days I went from waking up in a Sidewinder on a space station with some spare change to bounty hunting 220LYs away in a decked out Eagle. I want more, I need more. I'm far too abusive to my Eagle, she doesn't deserve half the things I put her through.    If you have a love for space, you belong in Elite: Dangerous. I've gotta head out now, been away from the cockpit for too long.    CMDR Valikraz",1,0

2817460,252670,Nihilumbra,Nihilumbra is philosophical. It just takes a bit more than half the game for it to say anything interesting. The narrator is indeed annoyingly heavy-handed and monotone. He also can't seem to decide if he's trying to be helpful or hurtful. At first I thought he was supposed to be the voice of the void itself but he quickly switched from cautioning you from parting the void to telling you to run from it. Just... What?  What I'm here for is the puzzles. I like puzzles. It's a shame that you have to get through the first half of the game (story mode) to get to the real ones. Its an even bigger shame that many of the real ones (void mode) are centered on saying 'NO you can't use that color here. Find the other way around this.' I prefer puzzles that force me to use all of my tools instead of those that simply stop me from using the most convenient ones. Personal preference but I must admit the puzzles still are pretty good (in void mode).  The music is nice and the art style is simple and effective. The game has run mostly smoothly for me with only a bit of trouble with brown glitching. I haven't quite finished the game but I've cleared the last two sections (both living forest and ash desert) in an hour each whereas the frozen cliffs took me much longer in void mode so I'm suspecting that I will be finishing entirely soon with an estimated full time of perhaps twelve hours so I consider this a short game.  It's worth getting (albeit on sale) if you like puzzles but (and this is a big but) it will take time to get to the valuable ones and the narrator is likely to aggravate those who either don't much care for philosophy or (like me) simply don't like being told what one is feeling. Gameplay good- storytelling mediocre. Recommended for puzzles and because a few people will really like the story despite the ham-handed nature of it.,1,0

After u get gear and feel comfortable dieing with it feel free to upgrade as u get decent stuff from it. As of the game and devs its super fun and being worked on constantly. The community has some cool mature peeps out there but also has those kids that scream racial slurs and call u bad cuz u died once. Ive put 200 hours into the game but id say half of them is me sleeping with the game open LOL. It is super addicting and i play it every day. Most negative reviews.....MOST have like 20 min to 2 hours into the game -_- u wont experience finding a legendary and 1v4'ing or doing awesome ♥♥♥♥ with ur team. Instead they get rekt by a dude with full gear and insta complain about the game. If ur thinking of getting the game get some friends to buy it with u and just have some fun and dont get mad about gear, its nothing like dayz when u die and ur heartbroken for all your gear.

1159639,218620,PAYDAY 2,PAYDAY 2 is a game where you can participate in heists of anything from jewlery stores to banks singleplayer with random people online or even your friends here are a few reasons why i like and dislike the game  Pros: - The game is great fun to play with friends and you can meet some really nice people to play with online. - The game gives hours of fun playing alone or together i may only have 25+ hours when writing this however i have enjoyed every second of it. - The developers update the game very regularly as in nearly once a week maby once every two weeks however that is a lot more than most devs. - The game can easily give you what you paid for as the game is £15 regularly and around £4 during the sales this means if you buy it during the sales like me i have gotten around 6 hours of play time per £1 and if i bought it full price nearly £2 per hour which is still very good.  Cons: - The developer introduced cases like CS:GO however this is not a very big problem and as of writing this the new cases are free. - The constant updates can be an annoyance if you want to play a quick game however it still shows how dedicated the devs are.  PS if you are buying this game during the sales dont worry it will barely make a dent in your wallet however check other reviews if you are buying it full priced as it may not be your type of game.,1,0

4757648,364930,Koi-Koi Japan [Hanafuda playing cards],"NOTE: Played a lot offline so low playtime!  Having self taught this game to myself and a group of friends, I have a good perspective on this game to the majority of people only playing this card game for the first time.   Positives: 1) Good Clean UI and very helpful card highlighting - Memorising which card matches with which is abit hard for many people (November especially) and this game allows you to play without having to memorise, which is great for getting players right in. 2) AI is fierce - A problem this game might have face would be an AI that just matches cards randomly but as far as I have seen the AI has been great so far. It capitalises on you being greedy and punishes you for it a lot. 3) Brilliant Tutorial - I made slides to teach this game to my friends. This game has it all written down and the limits of the what moves you can make and identifying the Yaku immediately helps it with beginners a lot. I think anyone looking to learn Hanafuda should start with the game.  Negatives: 1) House Rules? - The game at one stage said the game is played accross Japan with house rules and It would be GREAT if they had that here, especially with their collection mode which honestly needs a bit of more substance for it to have more replay value. 2) Multiplayer - This game badly needs this for the game community to expand. I have actual Hanafuda cards so I can get by without it but having this multiplayer function would be brilliant for this game. 3) One Trick AI - The AI is great and all but its play has little variance. Gets Yaku, 2 cards left? Stops. Gets 3 Brights? Chances are, stops. I have played with my friends and seen ridiculous draws like throwing down a Chrysanthenum card to only pick up a sake cup that just flipped open into double viewing combo (Moon, Sakura and Sake Cup). I don't see the AI having the balls to do that. I know making AI is hard but having some variance in AI, like one that plays more safely, another that plays aggressively will add so much depth into this game.  Looking at the collection mode, I feel that the game missed some chances to make it a Brilliant game because having all those individuals across Japan you can play against might be like some AI gauntlet with each with local house rules or differing AI. That would have been a strong feature that adds a lot of replayability but overall I love when traditional games like this get to see the light of day on Steam and gain a wider audience. Overall, I would reccomend this game to people who like traditional games that have a lot of luck involved but also a bit of skill.",1,0

3107678,265380,Grimind,"Bought this game for a mere 2.99 on sale. For that price, it offered 5-6 hours gameplay and some replayability. It is an Indie game, and I will treat it as such. The developer markets Grimind as a horror/physics puzzle game, and that is about as descriptive as it gets. The gameplay is centered around completing the puzzles without any instruction or hand-holding. Not to say the puzzles are unsolvably difficult, but there are a few moments in which I scratched my head in frustration and uttered a soft 'what the hell do I do?' to my computer monitor. Once you get the feel of how the game operates, the puzzles start to become clear. The physics are also quite well done. I understand the developer reworked the inertia of objects and some other parameters for the game's Steam release, and the attention to detail shows. It seems more polished compared to early alpha footage (as one would expect). Objects can be picked up and thrown, liquids respond to disturbances, and soft-bodied pieces like vines move as they should. The strong point of the game is the lighting. Beautifully done point lights and both 'baked' and active shadow casting as well as ambient gloom in certain points lends to a strong setting for a horror scenario. Many levels throw the character into the darkness with nothing but a lit torch, and as everything in the environment is opaque black, one understands that death may be around every turn. As for the 'scare factor?' Some reviewers have thought the game is as frightening as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is not necessarily true. The scariest part of the game is the environment itself. The player is pursued by malevolent little--welll--boxes (with no animation) that may only be vanquished with bright light. The enemy design is unbecomingly bland for a game that seems so well-put-together in every other regard. The chase sequences get one's heart pounding, but it is not fear. The character animation is perhaps a little poor as well. The sound work in the game is mixed. The background music/ambient noise are very impressive, and those elements are quite unsettling for the game. They chant at the player like spectral moans from an unknown source and never failed to cause my hair to stand on end. All other noises sound as though they were recorded by a desk mic in Audacity, like the growls of the monsters, drowning noises when underwater, and thunder of fallign boulders or objects. Their lack of quality just doesn't seem to fit, and they certainly didn't scare me. Lastly, the game's story and dialogue were originally written in Polish. (I believe?) The English translation is rough around the edges, but I could understand what was being conveyed with a little bit of pidgin translation. The story begins with no scenario, and ends with little more. It was more depressing of an end than a satisfying resolution. Perhaps there is a metaphorical message to it all? Nonetheless, I would have preferred to see a more complete story. Maybe in the sequel we can see more character development. I give this game 7.5/10. For what it was, I enjoyed every bit of it, but I also see room for polishing all around.",1,1

2322313,242050,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,"I didn't think they would ever beat AC2, but this is now my favourite in the series. The new story arc is a nice jumping on point for those new to the series, but still offers some nice tie ins to previous games for series veterans.   I found the side missions a lot more engaging than in the previous games too, and often found myself distracted by them on my way to a main mission.  On another positive note this runs a lot better on my machine than AC3 did on my AMD card (something to do with AMD being in the new consoles perhaps?) and manages pretty close to a stable 50 fps with everything maxed.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the awful follow missions are in the game again and there a quite a lot of them. If there were less of these boring missions then this would be close to perfect.",1,0

3658836,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I went in with high expectations, thanks video game media. I have to say my expectations have been blown out of the water by the actual game. It's one of the best games I've ever played.  Know that first time you saw something in Skyrim where you just had to stop for awhile and admire the setting? That happens all the time in Skellige. The lighting and weather seem perfect. My damn beard actually grows, I have to get it cut before visiting the jarl.  I made a priest look like a jerk in the beginning of the game, almost a week later some religious thugs tried killing me in the streets. I climbed up to the top of a hill and there was a lady who told me that if I wanted to fight her I'd have to beat some other guy up. I did, then when I beat her she rewarded me with sexy times. (watching video game sex is kind of creepy.)  The characters are fun to get to know, there's a lot of story just wandering around like a 'vagrant' the random NPCs seem to just go about their business. Most towns have something to do for somebody and there are no fetch quests, or other filler. Every quest seems uniquely written.  About the only thing I miss from Skyrim is the ability to just sit down on a bench and watch the scenery while eating a bowl of soup. There's no 'just relax' button. There's plenty of time for relaxing but that's when you're wandering between places.",1,1

3411040,280520,Crea,"I would like to point out that, in a sense, this game is very good and with such frequent updates has high potential. The game lags a lot less than it used to as well.  That being said, there is one part that makes me neutral on this game. The crafting system.  Essentially, I don't mind the format. What makes me slightly angry is that it takes a very long time to select a recipe, or even a category for it. It just takes forever to register. Whether it be ten seconds or five minutes, it takes ages.   This also applies to talents, inventory, character info, settings, and basically anything involving selecting an object or option.  The reason this is infuriating is because it takes twice as long to progress compared to how fast you *should* be progressing. I don't want to say this game is bad, but until this is fixed, I have to leave a 'don't recommend' on it for the time being, seeing as it's just an annoying chore to do anything.",-1,1

4255189,326950,Sword of Asumi,"I should've written this review a loooong time ago....  Product: Sword of Asumi Review Date: 8-15-2015 Reccomendation: No  Introduction: Sword of Asumi is a ten dollar visual novel that is barely worth 4 dollars, it's characters are stale the writing is lifeless, cleshe, and lazy and the pandoring is at the level as to which I am annoyed by it. Though that's not enough to save you your ten dollars is it? You still want to buy it right now.... well let me get more in depth with you this is the introduction after all.  Gameplay: Sword of Asumi plays like your regular visual novel you read and occasionally make decisions that will effect you're outcome of the story. It's the same old same old with no other gameplay mechanic. Now yes the decisions do effect your outcome and if you make some 'bad' decisions the game will play out it a different way. However in Sword of Asumi's case the game never really plays out too differently overall. There is a BIT of replay value but nothing spectacular. Now my BIG problem with Sword of Asumi's gameplay is it is SHORT! This game was originally what, like 15 dollars? The game doesn't really last longer than an hour or two. It's a bit ridiculous honestly. Though I can't really complain about the decisions too much the amount of gameplay you will be getting is kind of pathetic.  Story: Well ok, the story begins as you, Asumi, a member of an order of warriors named the Justicars and you infiltrate an estate to assasinate the owner. You get a quick peak at some decisions as you go through with your mission regardless. Then after that Kami, a fellow Justicar, aproaches you and congratulates you on a mission success while also briefing you on a new one. A rebel group called 'Orochi' deadset on overthrowing the government has been tracked by Kami, and the rest of the higher up Justicars for some time, and Kami has now found a new lead on one of their members codenamed 'Raven' who is residing at the prestigious school 'Battle Academy' so as a test of sorts to see if Asumi will be let into the higher ranks of the justicars, Kami sends Asumi into the school disguised as a first year student to stop Raven by killing them. (Why would you risk a lead this big on someone who isn't even an expert in your order, I know she's young enough for the role but there HAS to be SOMEBODY else!) So you then go to the school, meet the love interests and then set about on your mission. The story isn't horrible it's just very cliche and to be honest with not a lot of surprises. It's pretty bland to me. Along with that it's very rushed in it's delivery before you know it you're at the end of the line, as such you can't be as invested as you should be because suddenly the game is just over. However I'll give it this Asumi is always trying to accomplish her goal it's not like it's a bunch of filler with an occasional spout of progress. Though still, the story is very short, cliche, and rushed in it's delivery it's not very well thought out. The dialogue feels non-emotional and rushed as well it feels like they have a big checklist in front of them all the time checking off everything they need to make a quick buck.  Characters: THEY ARE ALL BLAND AND CLICHE! Nothing much more to say, other than they all have fanservice dedicated to them in several sections. You have the pretty shopping lightheaded-esque girl who is also bisexual, you have the smart one who likes to read and loves poetry etc. etc. you can tell that none of these characters took any thought into creating. The main villain was incredibly obvious, at least for me, and they're just not that interesting. You can tell the guy who made this literally spent the shortest ammount of time he could on these characters.  Romance: It's very quick and really isn't too believable for me. It just happens a little too fast and well it's just very bland and uncreative the situations you are put in don't really have that much creativity put into them they're just not very well written romances.  Setting: The game takes place in 'Battle Academy' a big school, yada yada yada. While I have seen school settings done SOOO many times before this one is still an ok setting I suppose but they don't show you enough of the school for you to truly appreciate that, part of that DEFINITELY has to do with the story's sense of rapid fire pacing.  Art: The art is ok, nothing really ugly about it...... EXCEPT THERE IS A ♥♥♥♥ TON OF FANSERVICE!!! The amount of times Asumi undresses is astonishing to me because it happens so often, not only does it get repetitive and its something they could've replace with scenes to make the story longer, but it's awkward and idiotic to see them pandor like this. On top of that it's not even just Asumi, the girls are drawn like they have a bunch of breast implants and the guys are ♥♥♥♥ing muscular as all hell. This is pandoring at it's near worst. On top of that no one receives character art besides the love interests and villains. The only exceptions to this are Kami and some twins. WHY YOU HAD SO MUCH MONEY WHY DID YOU NOT JUST DRAW MORE CHARACTERS UP!  Summary: Sword of Asumi had a kickstarter that raised them MORE than enough money to make a visual novel with decent length, unique/interesting characters and a lot of good art. They did not use that potential. Instead they made a boring, unsurprising, uncreative, pandoring, rushed, cheap, immination of what visual novels should be. It's sort of a scandal really. The people who made this game, AJTilley has a habbit of this, Beach Bounce was TERRIBLE and their other visual novels have the same syndrome. THEY ARE ALL RUSHED WITH NO CREATIVITY WITH FORCED DIALOGUE AND ROMANCE! DO NOT buy this game save your money. If you REALLY want a visual novel, well to be honest I reccomend Everlasting Summer, it's free and has more substance than this quick waste of your money and time.",-1,1

While not as bad as Arkham Knight's sorry state, Warner Bros decided to green-light the game. Lot of performance inconsistencies, unplayable stages (I'm looking at YOU, Sky Temple), lack of options on release.  After months trying to fix up the game, though, they've decided to pull the plug, call it even, and not continue supporting the PC playerbase. What does this mean for you, possible new costumer?  -No improved Network for the PC version. -No new characters (no Alien, Tri-borg, Bo-Rai-Cho or Leatherface) -No new skins -No new stages -No Mortal Kombat XL bundle, which would have included all DLC available plus all of the above  And most important yet: -No further fixes for issues that still remain (unplayable stages still unplayable), performance hiccups just because.  Be also warned, that WB Games has had two strikes already (first this, then Arkham Knight) so beware in the future, costumer.  Avoid this sorry excuse of a game/PC port.",1,0

834112,2100,Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Single Player,"I only thumb this down for one big reason but before we poke at that, lets look at the good stuff. Pros -  1. This game runs on the source engine so it has that Half Life feel and sound face into it, making for a very nostalgic piece.  Along with that, the game is very fast paced and has a good, even difficulty with plenty of enemys in it. 2. The Story while now adays is a bit easy to catch on to still has a good number of twists and confusing ends for you to try and figure out on the quest. 3. The Combat is strong and the branching trees and inventory are easy to play with. Overall it takes no effort to getting used to the controls, only getting used to the task bar really. With all these pros whats the one big issue with this game? Cons - It barely ever works. Reports from other players say they can barely get past the prologue, infact, the most infamous bug (the one I'm having) is that apparently, this old game from a generation ago will constantly crash on the major area of the game over and over and over. This ruins the entire experience as you'll be busy slashing at orcs while Leana is healing you, your about to land that killing blow! Then a black screen appears, the game says MM.exe is not working and all your blood lust is turned into rage. This is such a horrible flaw because its on every computer past Windows 8.1. That is total crap, the fact that an old game can't run on these high tech systems is like saying you can't use a bullet for your new fancy gun because it now needs 'Special Bullets'. Until I find a fix for this, steer clear of this game unless you are below Windows 8.1.",-1,0

4025141,312560,Xanadu Next,"It's a very cool action-RPG thus far. The story actually starts out surprisingly decent (though it seems like it has fallen off a bit now that I'm in the first real dungeon, but one event actually caught me off guard), and the combat is quite good. It feels satisfying AND forces you to make a lot of strategic choices. For example, one enemy explodes and hits every creature in the room, including yourself, when you kill it. Another enemy goes down far easier with magic, but can be killed with melee attacks if you're low. And magic reliably damages enemies that you're too weak to defeat in melee, but is VERY limited (i.e. you have to recharge in town or use MP restoratives, which aren't sold in shops, to get more spell charges).  And related to that, stats make a HUGE difference in this game... I went from only doing 1 damage against certain enemies and the first real boss to 1 - 3 shotting the enemies and having an actual chance against the boss simply by allocating all my level up points for one level into attack.  Death hurts in this game, and the difficulty is no joke. You lose every unimportant item you were carrying plus 50% of your gold. The only save point I've seen thus far is in town, but after you get a certain item, you can warp back to town any time you like, plus there's moderately expensive Diablo style portals you can buy on top of that that'll take you back to where you stopped, so there's quite the risk vs. reward system going on.  People who like lore in their games will love this. You collect tablets and journals, your companion translates them for you, and once translated, you get to read up on some of Xanadu's history.  ...Oh and, oddly enough, the game seems designed with keyboard and mouse in mind. You click and your character (who's default name is Falcom, so I can only assume they REALLY want you to name him either after yourself, or with a fancy name of your own making) goes there like in a PC hack and slash game. I think you can use controllers, though the store's page says 'partial controller support,' and given what that often means, I haven't brought myself to try it yet.  So yeah. Even if the rest of the game sucks, and I don't think it will, I'm glad Falcom, XSeed, and Marvelous brought this game over. I'd love to see more older RPGs like this that we didn't get back in their heyday.  UPDATE: Tried the controller. Actually worked mostly fine for me using an Xbox 360 controller. Only issue is, by default, you have to hold down the start button to use the mouse for navigating your equipment menu. The game still feels like it was designed purely with a keyboard and mouse in mind when it came out back in 2005, but a controller does have certain advantages, like having a single button for using items instead of four, and not having to 'aim' the cursor at enemies.  I also have run into some mild bugs, but nothing gamebreaking like some people are saying, just minor text bugs (seemed to happen when I used the default name of 'Falcom' for some reason, restarting and using an original name seemed to fix it), and a weird graphical glitch in one room that quickly went away.  I've heard of more serious things happening, but haven't run into them myself, so I cannot comment on them. I'll just say, be aware that there might be issues.  I still highly recommend the game though. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying. The combat just feels great, and the way you explore in this game is extremely well done, unlocking bits of the island and its dungeons piece by piece.",1,1

The inventory is pretty interesting, each weapon takes up a certain amount on your inventory screen. The chainsaw, being one of the best melee weapons in the game, covers up the most inventory space [I think, haven't played much to know]. The ammo is limited, and the experience is great for a F2P model. Oh, and that too. It's truely F2P.

The game is actually much simpler and more intuitive to play than it is to describe. Try watching  this YouTube clip  if you want to see how it works.

4753772,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"While I enjoy this game to an extent I did not enjoy it as much as other Total War games (One of my favorite franchises).But first what I did like about this game is that it introduces fantasy into the Total War realm. For me this is a big plus as it adds a completely new aspect to the game that makes the battles for interesting. I find that this total war actually is my favorite for battles: the monsters, the different races, guns, cannons, helicopters, magic. All these make battles more fun and strategic. However, for me the campaign was seriously laking. Not for my first playthrough but soon enough it was too repetitive regardless of the faction. I found the map dull and uninteresting lacking the strategic geography of Europe, Japan, or any other of Total War's traditional game settings. Its a big plain, some mountains, Scandinavia, and a big deseret allseparated by 2 inlets. Every game Chaos invades around the same time, coalitions are formed around the same time when the shield of civilazation forms (for Dwarf and Humans) and you win by virtually automatic coalitions. After fighting chaos for a bit and the same copy-paste enemy faction that that faction always faces (Dwarf, Human, undead, or Ork). Like maybe the different empire factions shouldn't have identical rosters? Maybe more than one should be playable? Maybe the entire human race shouldn't be on one giant plain (Bretonia and Border princes don't count as their not technically playable)?! Overall I think this game could be much better if it wasn't pigeonholed into the warhammer realm... more factions, more campaign map diversity, some variations on the sequence of events, etc.   To summarize only get this game if: you are a big total war fan, you like the Warhammer universe, you primarily like total war battles, or are only looking for a few playthroughs. Don't get it if you mainly enjoy the campaign and expect a degree of diversity each new campaign and major replayability.  I played more than I expected because I'm a big fan of the franchise and fantasy but I doubt most fall in that category.",-1,0

As someone in a creative field, myself, I can see what's happening in the reviews for this and it's starting to make me sick. The last thing a creative person needs is for the world to say 'I liked that last thing you did better', and that's all that the big review sites are doing right now. For someone to really push themselves and find new aspects of their art and their creation process, they have to stretch their legs and try new things - in my case I try drawing different art styles, I try different media, just to see what I can learn about it and whether I like the way I do it.  This is a pretty bold step in game creation for these guys, Mr. Gao in particular, and it might not seem like such a big deal but to try and tell a story through just actions and visuals (and fantastic music) is a lot more challenging than you might think. I think they did a great job, considering the length, and considering how little we got to know the characters within the frame of the story.  I understand if you have your preferences between games from Freebird, and that's fine, I have preferences with my own work as well, but at the end of the day you can't vilify people for trying new things.

5991473,550,Left 4 Dead 2,"I can't believe this game is so old, considering it is still one of the best zombie games I've ever played. The gameplay is fun and exciting, and there is nothing more satisfying than surviving a round with your freinds. The maps are all unique and creative, each offering a new setting to kill zombies, keeping everything fresh. The special infected are great as they really add another dimension of teamwork and awareness. And even though the graphics are 7 years old, they still look great and almost up to par with other zombie games, and needless to say can run well on a wide variety of computers. Overall, 9.5/10, this game is totally worth the 20$, I'd even play more.",1,0

4568915,350780,MANOS: The Hands of Fate ~ Director's Cut,"Original premise for a game... too bad the game itself is an unoriginal NES platformer.  As Mike, you must survive through Valley Lodge by leaving your family behind in order to jump, run and shoot snakes with a pistol. Sometimes you get a shotgun, which shoots a three-way projectile that won't hit anything else than whatever's in front of you. The first two levels of the game follow the movie, but everything is thrown out the window once you reach Level 3, which looks like Castlevania... as in it reuses the same graphics! Also, the boss of this level was supposedly so good it got reused in AVGN Adventures.  When Level 4 starts, your protagonist says 'What a horrible night to have a missing wife and child!'. Enough said.  As the game advances, the game stops bothering with Manos and becomes a Mystery Science Theater 3000 tribute. Tom Servo does a cameo in Level 2 and most levels involve enemies from other B-movies like Hobgoblins, Robot Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why call it Manos then? The setting fails because the writing is all centered on references, trying really hard to wink at you and say 'Hey this happened in the movie, right?'  The game could have been good if the gameplay was interesting, but it isn't. You only shoot in a horizontal line and enemies just bounce back and forth forever, making fighting a joyless affair. Bosses are equally as mindless. The only challenge the game offers comes from occasionally unfair enemy and trap placement, where upon hitting them, you will bounce back in a pit and die. The game sometimes spice things up by making the whole screen dark around you, preventing you from anticipating obstacles and multiplying deaths where you fall in pits. Other levels are autoscrollers, which don't really have a reason for happening and forces you to progress at the game's pace. There's also a vertical autoscrolling level that rips off Castlevania 3.  Overall presentation is also weak. The graphics and sound are appropriately NES-styled, but they have no substance and fail at making an impression. The game also offers difficulty levels, but don't bother with them: all they do is remove health pickups, shotguns and checkpoints from levels. Yes, it makes the game harder, but it doesn't make it fun.  Manos will take you about 45 minutes to finish, maybe more if you want to get the full ending or finish the Torgo playthrough, which just switches sprites, makes you do lots of annoying noises and is slippery as all hell. The complete unoriginality is what mainly kills the game though; it doesn't attempt to add anything new to the old-school game formula, unlike games like Shovel Knight, Binding of Isaac or Axiom Verge. This game is about as faithful to its source material than a LJN game would be, so it's good at reminding you of LJN!",-1,1

6107791,57900,Duke Nukem Forever,"NOTE: This Is an update for the review, much more detail of the game and such. Pointing out the good and bad of the game.  Ahh, we've been waiting forever for Duke Nukem Forever. An game that's been In developement hell for 12 years. And the squeal to Duke Nukem 3D, and DNF basically Ignored the past Duke spin-offs like Zero Hour, Land of the Babes, and Time to Kill. Since THIS IS, a squeal to Duke3D.  Now, this game Is known for being an pretty bad game, reviewers mostly point out the flaws Instead of the good. There Is some good, there Is some bad. The Good, Is Duke himself, he hasn't changed much, not one bit. The Babes are back (they do look souless xD), the weapons from Duke3D return once again, and the combat Is pretty good. The Bad, Is the wall boobs (yes, there Is wall boobs, you can slap them), the jokes aren't as clever anymore, they're more Immature once and a while. The regenerating health, and two weapon thing (there Is an option to expand the Inventory). They tried mixing classic FPS and modern FPS, the two. Really don't go together, but DNF kind of done It right. The game was pretty fun, It's kind of addicting also. Specially the Muiltplayer. But, there IS some hackers In the Muiltplayer. Which kind of makes It, not so fun at times. So, I'd suggest getting out of a game If you spot an hacker.  Well, the story feels more like a rehash or retelling of Duke3D, Ailens have returned to Earth once again to capture the women, and Duke yet again has to save the world. Simple story for simple fun! The levels are an bit linear at this time, but they're fine.  The game also has an DLC which gives you another campiang called The Doctor Who Cloned Me. (I haven't tried this out yet). And some Muiltplayer DLC which adds more maps.  Would I recommend DNF? Well, sure It has some flaws and It's hated on deeply. But Hey, It's better than Postal 3, which Is an game RWS doesn't want you to even buy! DNF has some good In there, and It's totally recommended. A good 7/10 In my book!",1,0

It doesn't matter how cheep it was or how cheep it comes , it will always feel as if you payed to much. And it is true! You will pay. With your soul.  I could up-vote this game like the trolls who give fake reviews, but that's just not me. I always try to let my inner freak out in the reviews when I like something and I especially won't hold back when I hate something like this little piece of pain. I don't get paid, so I don't fear consequences and I don't like cats that much that it would interfere.  This game comes from 'Invent4 Entertainment' and publishers with the name 'Strategy First'. How dares someone to have that name and than release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like this one? It feels as if this game was abandoned in alpha develop and someone desperately tried to make money with it anyway. The physics should be the mayor deal when you need them to fulfill the goal of a game. Every time I failed and the cat started laughing, it felt as if the developers would laugh about me having paid for this crap.  In this physic-game is no physic. You might think it is bad, but it is worse. You got 30 tries per level, so they must know that it is not working correctly. It would even show you the genius plan in the first place and it still won't work. There is not even logic in his game. In one of the first levels you would need to let a ball hit a shotgun to win. The shotgun would fall, get of and kill the cat. You could also place a rat with an baseball bat next to the shotgun and... well... no. I get it, they don't want to kill the cat, you do. The rats only wan't to play some ball, but at least the game could refuse the rat-placement next to the gun than.  Now let's talk about the concept here: Rats kill cats. Sounds okay. That was it. Don't expect an story, any kind of background or even an intro. There is an start menu and the first level is a tutorial. Minimalism can be great, but there is this alpha-feeling again.  Let us judge the graphics now. I am not the biggest fan of high def graphics. When I like a game, I don't even care if it looks like 8 Bit or just not like newest standards. This game looks like an game that I played 17 years ago and it was an game to promote content for the sexindustry, running on windows 95 and so low even back in days because it was mostly just a joke to sell better. I ask myself if this is a joke?! Is this a joke?  Bad Rats rates itself in the title and there is nothing left to say.  0/10 Bad Rats bad!",-1,1

5029342,386070,Planetary Annihilation: TITANS,"&lt;edit&gt; I am adressing this as an expansion, not as the original game, stating that I would not recommend buying the expansion if you already have the original. I got the expansion for free as I backed PA very early on.  If you don't own the game and are looking for a quirky RTS following the Total Annihilation line then this game is certainly worth a look.  The following is a bit about my background with the RTS genre as well as a few of the gripes I hold towards the game. &lt;/edit&gt;  I herald back from the time of Total Annihilation, the RTS that got me into RTS's, a fantastic game that I would suggest it to any RTS lover who's willing to deal with the somewhat dated graphics. I moved onto Supreme Commander, which was in essence an enjoyable evolution from TA, SupCom being great for competative and social play, with its many facets. Then came about Forged Alliance, a stand alone expansion from SupCom, which brought a new faction, SP campaign and features, whilst still holding onto the core principles that made SupCom a great and worthy successor to TA. Then there was SupCom 2...... ok ..... that game was a massive let down, being thrown into the casual pit, it wasn't in the same boat as TA and SupCom(/FA) and although it had some 'interesting' things, it was in essence very bland. When I saw the kickstarter for Planetary Annihilation, I thought it looked amazing, I thought it looked like TA but being over multiple planets... large solar systems and galaxies to wage war across.... perhaps a place where large numbers of players could be part of the same galaxy, holding worlds for their respective factions/clans..... I know a man can dream right..... So, I got onboard the kickstarter, dreams of conquest and strategic complexity whirring through my mind.... As you can imagine I was a little disapointed with the initial game, but I thought that it could grow into the competative powerhouse I had invisioned...... I waited so long...... then TITANS..... This isn't a really good RTS from a competitive standpoint.... a lot of the wow and awe moments of this game don't actually come across if you are 'playing to win'. Winning is easy, just take out the commander, which has been the goal of all previous games of this theme, but in past games, turtling up and protecting your commander was a doable task, but not here... when you have intel on a commanders location is ridiculously easy to take him out as he is nothing more than a large fabricator bot. The only time the commander is safe is in the first 3-4 mins of the game where his weapons are such that it can take out the small number of early units sent his way, able to fend them off whilst constructing. When the game gets to min 5 however it all changes.... Depending on your build strategy in the first 4 mins will determine whether you will win or lose the game and it is all based on numbers, not economic number as was the case with SupCom, but the number of factories you have setup and the amount of tanks you have..... 8 early game flame tanks is all you need to kill the commander... aproaching from at least 2 vectors can almost guarantee you a win unless your opponent has also built flame tanks. The risk/reward for just spamming flame tanks is so greatly in your favor that there is little point doing anything else.... heck even if they are on another world, it just takes a little intel and a handful of flame tanks and even the most developed worlds won't save your commander from utter destruction. No amount of defensive structures will keep you alive..... you can't turtle in PA, there is only one viable strategy and that is rush and that makes this a very boring RTS, which is why I cannot recommend it.....  &lt;edit&gt; Thanks to SKaREO for pointing this out. The game is not without its complexity and resource management is cruicial if you are to succeed, but as that is no different from SupCom or TA, I didn't feel it was required in my review. &lt;/edit&gt;",-1,1

I would add a completely customizable lot to build the perfect (try to, anyway) refugee camp. Add a more complex skill tree so each time you play it, State of Decay becomes a new game. Customizable characters. Start the game off by taking orders and being a part of the community, instead of immediately leading the community.

In the midst of a firefight, its easy to get tunnel vision and mistake enemy for ally (at a distance, at least).There is an incredible sense of tension in this game that very little shooters these days are able to provide.

3038600,262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I took a look at the negative reviews and decided to throw my own two cents concerning some common complaints about the game. First, corpses, the most controversial addition. People don't seem to understand thier purpose in the gameplay. They saw it is unnesacery and stupid, but they have a purpose. It's to make combat last longer and expose your heros to danger. Also, if you fight smart you can prevent corpses from even showing up, how I won't spoil it, but that is what the game is about, danger, death, and general hopelessness, and exposure to combat emplifies this.   The next point, people are saying that this game is hard and unfair. Hard I agree with, just watch the trailer. Unfair, not so much, I have yet to run into a situation where I felt cheated. When I first interacted with some of the objects on the map, I got some negative and positive results, but I learned what they were and could expect them and bring supplies to prepare for next time. I also got some consistently negative results from certain interactables, but learned to bring some extra items into certain areas to reap rewards from them next time. As for combat, I lost some heroes, but I always saw it coming, I knew someone was going to die and tried to help them, and it was an amazing sequence when they did survive. The game is not easy, but you have to learn it to understand its gameplay.  There is also the grindy gameplay that people talk about. I can't deny that the gameplay is a little grindy, but even when they had only constructed 3 areas to explore in early release, I never felt bored. Each area has its own personality, its own challenges, and its up to the player to learn them. I also see people comparing this game to other rpgs and I have to say, NO other rpg advertises the fact that your characters can be wiped out in one quest gone wrong. This is not like other rpgs. it is not trying to be other rpgs, so stop comparing it. (This is an edit posted after you can upgrade your stagecoach to bring in heroes up to level 3. This was a very clever move as it costs much less to fully upgrade your hero. It even gives them more starting skills so you can experiment. Their equipment and skills are basically at full minus the final upgrade. Well played red hook.)  Lastly I will say that I have come back to this game every so often and tried each new feature, the abomination, the heart attacks, the corpses, all of them. I keep one file with all of this stuff turned on, and another with everything turned off, as my 'easy' file. While playing each of these I found that I advanced quicker in my easy file, but i spent less time in dungeons. Remember what I said about the corpses making fights longer? It's not that the new features make the game more likely to kill you, it gives the game more time to kill you, big difference. I also found that I did not feel any less satisfied on my easy file, or more relaxed. It felt the same, but I made more progress.   So, should you get this game? Watch the trailer, decide if you are okay with a game designed to kill you, and think about how you want to play. To hard? shut of the extra elements. Can't figure out how get at a lock box without bleeding? experiment with items. Be patient with this game and learn from your mistakes to better your chances. That's the way to enjoy this game.  Also an honorable mention for the narrator voice. Amazing lines and amazing voice!",1,1
595630,204300,Awesomenauts,This is truly a awesome game and deserves to have its name as awesomenauts. Even though I am not good at this game I still love love almost everything especially the graphics and cartoony designs. This game is another one of those Moba games which stands for multiplayer online battle arena. This game is a unique Moba since no other features cartoony graphics like or like this game haves a 2d view and super easy controls. Every time I play this game I feel like as if I am watching a cartoon of some sort it's really fun. The only downside of the game is just the amount of people who plays the game there aren't that many people and that is the problem this game is not very known. Well overall this is just a awesome game and words can't describe and you should try it out super fun. Also if you like the game please share with your friends to make the community bigger and better!,1,0
2258123,24010,Train Simulator,"It´s THE TRAIN SIMULATION game on the market.  People complain that the dlcs are too expensive. They are wrong. Train Simulator is the only game on Steam I know where every user got this one unique game through this dlc policy of dovtail games.  1) They give you every year a FREE update to the latest version of the game. Do you know any other publisher at all who is doing this? I dont.  2) Train Simulator is a game where u WONT buy or own all dlcs. Its not like sims where u have collect everything and had to buy more or less the latest addon. At Train Simulator u can choose which Trains and Tracks u wanna own. I do prefer the German ones and dont give a ♥♥♥♥ to the UK / US ones. So I wont buy them. I have also only bought the ones which I really want to (in my case the ICE trains + the tracks) and theres one more good thing about it. There are so many combined buy offers so you get at least 40% off. (most time track + train) The collection of every user is unique and thats also unique to this game!  Every year the latest version of the game for free, no season pass force. Some gamers are helpless and unable to decide and then they are complaining that the game is too expensive. They are wrong.  #Today.  #Tomorrw.  #Forever!  I do higly recommend Train Simulator aka Railworks. They do have a more than a fair DLC policy, but some ppl. do recommend to pay 60 euro at release + 50 euro for a season pass. And that every year. They just need to start to calculate through that!...",1,1

Yay slavery.)  - Like the idea of having sex with people of a questionable age  - Like the idea of having a romantic relationship with someone that (it seems, from one comment the main character makes) is going to die of old age in like ten years   - Like polygamy  - Like the idea of your sister trying to/ wanting to sleep with you  If you don't instal that patch why on earth would you want to play this game? Though the points above still apply only the sex is only implied. Which honestly is kind of an improvement. Though some of the animations are pretty nice if you turn off the sound.  On the plus side the animations/expressions are pretty cool and the sister subplot, while a little disturbing, is kind of funny.  2/10 Difficult to fap to  Also not a very enjoyable story and kind of distrubing in a lot of ways.   If I was going to summarise the game in one word it would be cringy.  p.s.

2055699,236390,War Thunder,"First of all, I'm going to talk more and less about Aircraft part of the game.  I recommend this game to those who feel interested in WWII dogfights, but not to those who are willing to fly post WWII planes in this game. So let's get into it.   Good features  + Very good graphics, good for various machinimas, sometimes it's a bit glithy, but that's not a big problem.  + Players can choose from various mods/ difficulties.  + Huge number of faction and vehicles.  + Connection between Ground Forces and Aircrafts.  + Squadron system, though devs should pay a lot more attention to this one, I think it motivates people to do better, when fighting.  + Sometimes funny events.  + Though you can buy some extra content to the game, it's not Pay to win, since you can buy some premium vehicles or hasten your research, but those don't effect gameplay a lot.   Bad features  - Funny and rewardfull singleplayer is something that is missing. Singleplayer itself is present in-game, but it does reward very badly and isn't fun at all.   -Jet battles are part of the game which I hate most and is very bad itself, let me explain you why. Meteor F. Mark 3. is aircraft used in WWII. On the other side is MiG 15 BiS, aircraft used during Korean War ten years after WWII. And these two aircrafts fight one another. And Meteor isn't the only aircraft that has to deal with it, there are many more. Though Match Making tries to rebalance the game putting some aircrafts with same 'POWER' to the other team, it fails deeply.  -Modification system is yet another pretty bad part of this game, I have another great explanation for this one. When flying recently bought British aircrafts armed with 20mm Hisppanoas your starting ammo is 'PRACTICE AMMO' really?? Another great example is researching your G-suit or extinguisher in tanks, or when flying De havilland Venom Fighter-BOMBER you have to research your bombs and it takes a lot of time belive me. This system should die, since it ruins game balance, any logics and historical correction.  -Physics aren't bad in this game, however sometimes really buggy, which makes you really angry, hopefully devs will pay more attention to this one.  -Low simulator community, makes it really hard for you to play simulator part of the game. I won't even mention that game won't learn you any basics about simulator, moreover landing.  Now you are going to ask your self, why I didn't recommend the game to you, since there are more pluses than minuses? I'll give you a simple answer, those bad features disgusted me so much, that I wouldn't recommend this game to my friends. WarThunder is still in Beta, so things can change, but at the moment I can't recommend it to you.   I hope I told you everything you needed to know about this game :)   ",-1,0

The Gameplay is what you would expect from a singleplayer shooter: Walk the path, enjoy the scenery, look for items, shoot bad guys. And Bioshock offers this in an insanely good way, with a story and lore that really entertained me. From the ultranationalistic and christian extremist columbians to the Vox Populi, everything about the world entertained me, and even if you don't like that kind of story, the artstyle provides enough to keep you entertained, at least if you like the american Stars and Stripes aesthetic and 1910s-1930s look.

There is fun to be had if you can create it yourself but its definitely not what they advertise.,-1,0

3949765,310080,Hatoful Boyfriend,"The first VN I have played in my life, and one of the more enjoyable VNs I have experienced in my life as well (which isn't a lot mind you).   Hatoful Boyfriend is about dating birds, and over time, finding out the events that lead to a human girl attending a pigeon school and forming romantic relationships with them. Hatoful plays with its unique premise, leading the way for pigeon related antics and such. The comedy is great in the VN, the drama fits, and everything works out. The staff even managed to fit in a number of anime or japanese pop culture references into the show as well, which may or may not be your thing (it definitely was enjoyable for me).   The second part of the VN, is where a lot of the history of the setting is explained, and trades all of the comedy and silliness for drama. The drama is decent, the payoff is pretty meh, the story and background is pretty well done and fleshed out. The second part is also incredibly long, like hours long, just a warning.  Overall Hatoful Boyfriend is an enjoyable experience. Each route is quite special in its own way, and they each have a certain charm to them. Having to perfect this game didn't bother me at all, as I had fun playing it all the way through.",1,0

3418016,281990,Stellaris,"I found a preFTL industrial fox people civ, I built an Observation station...  I do the following...  -aggressive observation -infiltration and annex  I aggressivly observe them and get 6+ research, then I decide to annex them into my empire...   It takes 20-30 years, and they are now apart of the Imperium of Man, Holy Terra, the seat on which the God Emperor recides, all Xenos will be purged...after I enslave them first... put the fox people to work, minerals and energy skyrocket, then when I found 4 more preFTL civs, I purged the fox people, and populate the planet with superior humans.   Long live the God Emperor.   Stellaris is an amazing empire managment game.. it is advertised as a 4x game, and it is exactly that.  Starting off, you can completely customize your empire, mods support at launch makes customizing endless... ye endless spac---   ANYWAY, HERE ARE PROS AND CONS for Stellaris.   ***PROS****!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D  Empire setting up--- Potentially limitless customization.  Visuals--- Its beauitful, well animated, great lighting, great portraits, lots of polish.  Sound--- It great, from the sound of different ships, to different weapons, to different worlds when you click on them, hearing a tropical from an arid, to a desert, very awesome.  UI--- some people said this is a nightmare, actually its great, there are few things hit and miss, but overall great start to a launch title! (please put UPGRADE ALL on controllable planets...)  AI--- the AI is good/bad/great, it really depends, some people say its dumb, no, not really. They declare war on you when you're a threat or they want something, really dependent on what and who they are. But if you see an empire with +14 approval, chances are they aint going to delcare war, as for fleets battles, they run away if they think they are losing, very sins of a solar empire.  GAMEPLAY!!!!!!!!!  --eXploring is the best out of all 4x titles, your exploring science ship has a leader you choose, who come with their own bonuses and levels, making exploring even better. By exploring you have chances to get technologies, artifacts, info on resources, discovering preFTL civs, other space empires, and giant space creatures. There are three types of FTL, Warpdrive, Hyperdrive and Wormholes, all are unlocked end game, each are better and worse than the other.  --eXpand is great, once you are past 5 planets, the game will suggest creating regions, AI managed areas to ease micromanaging, as 4x Vets know the micro hell. You can build stations that extend your influence as far as your FTL can take you. You can set up alliances, or federations with other friendly empires, vassal enemy empires or plain old conquer them to expand.   --eXploiting is also fantastic, resources improve your empire that you get from planets, suns, black holes, enslaved aliens/your own people, or dumb/sentient robots who can all rise up against you. Research is very expansive, with three different research areas that throw four-six different techs at you to choose every time a new tech is researched. It is randomized, and pretty fantastic, as it feels fresh every new game. Ship designer is ok, it only lets you play with the inner workings, which some people may prefer.  --eXterminating is straightforward, build giant blob of ships, send ships to kill.   The combat is rock, paper, scissors... A, will be better than B, but worse than C, etc.   Its a good system. There are 6+ empire ship visual variations, more with mods now and in the future.  After you conquer an alien planet, you can choose to purge them. You have three stages of orbitial bombardment, light, mid, full and the game responds in both audio and visually to the choices.  The game also has factions which develop in your empire, If left unchecked, can detach and create their own empire, and can be dealth with in numerous ways, PURGE!!!!!!!!.  Diplomacy is quite indepth and has different ways to dealing with an alien empire, alien empires interact with eachother and can if they all hate you, gang up on you.    **CONS**............... :(  Stellaris does 4x incredibly, but there are things that should be there, which are not...Otherwise I would be still playing. The game is, GREAT GREAT FANTASTIC, but the other side of it, is nothing, nothing, nothing. There is nothing bad about the game, its ridiculously well made, just needs more.  1-5 are required, as currently there are better 4x titles out there overall.  1. No Espionage, none---- Huge empires that are pure evil, can only be dealt with an alliance of other empires, other games have this too, however with espionage, you can turn the tide of war.   2. No Trade lanes/ships, none----- You can setup trade deals with empires that last 10-30 years, but no civilian ships, or industrial ships, flying around your empire, passively increasing relations and economy with alien empires. Without it, it just makes the game look, kind of stagnant, and not living.  3. No more than two ways to get Influence, seeing how Influence is such an important resource in this game, you can only get it by rivaling an enemy empire, or upgrading your planets HQ... It needs more sources, making alliances with empires, federations, taking over an enemy empire and emancipating its slaves, etc.  4. No automation, this is needed, badly, the automation starts at regions, and ends there. When you build a colony ship, it would be amazing to automate it to colonize a colonizable planet within the limit of its FTL... and automate a constructer to just build stations around the empire, and actually automate exploration and discovery... so it can let you focus on the true aspect of Stellaris, which is running your empires inner workings and dealing with aliens.   5. No key binding change, you cant edit your keys, weird, very weird, Paradox fix this soon.. please.  6. No tools to make the game a bit faster.. I love my lengthy games, but as it is right now, its a grind, without a deep mid game like the early game, and more fleshed out end game, it is a grind to go through the pace Paradox wants it to be..   These must be put in, to give the game bigger legs than it has.  Below are just crazy ideas.  No massive ships, this is more of an addon to make the game even better, than something required. After building a battleship, build dreadnaughts, or a death star to blow up planets, like in Gal Civ 2, there is the terror star and blows up entire systems. I have seen a broken up planet around a black hole in Stellaris, and it was fantastic to look at, this is something that can be done, just to add more eXterminate to the game.  No visual variation between alien thrusters on the back of ships, this is tiny, and I think easily changed, but its annoying when there is an alien empire using something that looks very similar to your own.  No SUPER indepth terraforming or insane building, you can terraformendgame you should be able to terraform EVERYTHING, screw it, its set in space in the future, technology shouldnt be limited. I want to build rings like the forerunners, and from that have different visual variations for the alien empires, as well as technologically. And or building actual planets, artifically created living worlds.  No game changing resource/wonder, wouldnt' it be great if there was something that would change the war around immediately that you randomly found through discovery, something that allows you to either blow up planets or rip them apart for ridiculous amounts of resources.   VERDICT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you're swayed by the prettiness, the polish, the Empire managing complexity, buy this game.    If the things that are missing bother you, Id say wait. Overall good game, in a year or two, it will be the defining 4x civ space game, and I will live on it, goodbye life, in 6months/year/two years. Why isnt there a maybe thumb!  7/10",1,0

2201931,239140,Dying Light,"I must say that I'm really enjoying Dying Light so far. The open world and crafting does have a Far Cry feel to it, but this is a good thing! I wouldn't mind a few more real weapons, like, let's say Far Cry. A baseball bat isn't really much of a weapon compared to a Z93. The parkour element is an absolute blast! The only thing more fun than leaping from building to building like Spider-Man is booting a zombie off of a high rooftop and watching it splat on the ground below! I give it 9 out of 10. Half a point goes to directly to Techland and Steam for the free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition.  p.s. There is also a Dying Light Companion app for Android and iOS. I have the Android version. It's pretty simple and an easy way to add  stuff to your Dying Light game, as it can be linked to your Steam account.",1,0
4899567,377160,Fallout 4,"As countless others have already mentioned, this is a half decent shooter but a bland as crackers Fallout game. The RPG part of Fallout is GONE narrative wise, completely removed in favour of a voiced protag who's easily as uninteresting as the lead from Watch Dogs (whatever his name was) and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft mechanic that only works in a superficial sense and has no real benefit. The replayability is also hampered by the ̶f̶o̶u̶r̶ but really just one dialogue choice and the removal of the Karma system. Beth has never been great at stories but to add on top of the already weak narrative mechanics is their worst writing to date. Nothing stands out.  Most of the rest of the RPG elements have also been removed with an expanded weapons system which hardly makes up for what was gutted out.  Graphically it's all over the shop. Character models and weapons look upgraded from Fallout 3/NV but the world itself still looks like a budget PS3 title.   The first 2 DLC's are glorified asset additions and Far Harbor is just as bland as the rest of the game and even uglier with all the fog.  Lastly the modding capability: Yes mods MIGHT fix a lot of what's wrong with it but so far a lot of the big Fallout/Skyrim modders look MIA, like they've already lost interest in this and most of the mods (outside of weapons) are little superficial things that don't really add much to the experience. I wouldn't blame them for not really wanting to fix this boring mess as they'll be trying to rebuild 3/4's of the game.   Personally I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, it's an average game at best. If you haven't bought in yet, wait a couple of years to see if the mods make it worth a buy then.",-1,0

The game is one of the best in its category and one I highly recommend to players who love a good story and characters they can build connections with. You'll learn each of the characters' lore, discover secrets, and battle your way through issues like corruption, poverty, prostitution, dishonesty, and trust -- all of which we experience and can relate to in the world we currently live in.

If their was a title worthy of your time and you haven't already played a real time strategy Id recommend this one.  If you have ever played the first Starcraft this is roughly the same kind of game and similar graphics. Gather resources build an army and take out everyone else.

TL;DR This game is awesome, you will not regret buying it. Good story, music, emotional feels, characters, lore, easter eggs, puzzles, fights, boss fights and so much more. ",1,0

5278840,40100,Supreme Commander 2,"-Downgrade on scale(map size / unit count) -Abolished the resource system -No longer tech units(tech 1,2,3) -Single player campaign is meh. Can't remember the story or characters at all.  +Cool new fun experimentals like bomb bouncer +Tech tree is fun. Upgrading existing units + commander +Runs smoother, probably thanks to the downgrade. +Experimentals like big and small experimentals are nice. More emphasis.  Summary: SupCom FA &gt; SupCom 2. After putting a lot of hours into FA, I find SupCom 2 although different still has some fun elements in it to play it. Suggest buying FA, playing it for 50+ hours(Campaign of normal Supcom, not FA, has a lot of cool story, worth completing story for all 3 factions + multiplayer). If you still want more buy Supcom 2.  Last note: Although I find all supcom games super fun, and FA the best RTS of all time, my opinion is still 'slightly' biased. SupCom FA is dated and both SupCom FA + SupCom 2 multiplayer have almost no only online players left.   ",1,0

The difficulty isn't too high, it's pretty fair and plays at a slow pace that should be enjoyable for anyone skilled in platformers or not. If you are, however, the amount of content included shouldn't keep you playing after roughly eight hours. I finished my completionist run around the seven hour mark as you can see above. One big nitpick I have is there is really no options menu, so... no rebindable keys and the only resolution options you have are windowed or fullscreen mode.

But if I hadn't grown up during the nineties, been around for the riot grrl scene, and lived through that era, I can't say I would have really been interested in the game or had the patience to see it to the end.  This game is all about the mystery and relies heavily on the story, not the gameplay, which is quite pedestrian and tedious at times.

I have played about 3/4s of it so far fully solo, and have never felt disappointed. There are very few foes who I find are impossible to beat on your own (at least at low difficulty).   This game has one of the most extensive skill trees I have ever seen. Your 'class' simply determines your starting weapon and where on the tree your character begins. No ability is restricted to a single class, and a lot of the abilities on the skill tree are repeated in all the areas, so that any character can reach any ability within a reasonable number of levels.",1,0

Spent 1 hour in game, made decent progress, started it up a week later and there was no saved game found.

2114325,238210,System Shock 2,"It’s been almost 10 years since I last played System Shock 2. The nostalgia I have for this great survival horror rpg is incredible. Everything that established my love for games can be found in this game. Great atmosphere, great gameplay, a mysterious and enticing story, great environment design, the whole package. Considering it’s a re-release from 1999 with updated compatibility for modern systems, it’s well worth the current price. Night Dive studios have done a great job at fixing up the game and making it available for the modern audience.   Now if you’ve played  any  of the Bioshock games you will most likely fall in love with System Shock 2. Irrational Games (most notably Ken Levine) built the System Shock games before moving onto the Bioshock games and they share many similarities in terms of pacing and story. I’m going to refer to similarities between both these game series so that more modern gamers can more easily understand System Shock 2.   System Shock 2 really does stand on its own as a unique adventure that throws you into the bowels of a distressed spaceship. Unlike Bioshock though, there are many more RPG elements. Your character uses cyber modules earned by completing objectives to unlock upgrades and skills. You have an inventory that can hold various different in game items. Weapons degrade over time, different armours can be equipped, and parts of enemies can be researched to find weaknesses. Also similar to Bioshock, there’s a lot of scrounging. You have to constantly look for supplies and ways to stay alive. Finding that one clip for your pistol or hiding from enemies as they search for you. Irrational games KNOW how to make tense situations and I love it.  In terms of survival horror, it doesn’t get much better than this. I remember being terrified of certain parts back when I was younger, and to an extent, these parts still scare me! That feeling of dread around every corner is very common. The sound design is made so well that it enhances the atmosphere in ways I can’t easily describe. This is something that was done well in the Bioshock games too.   The graphics are great too! All resolutions are supported up to 1920x1080 and many mods can be applied that further enhance textures, models, etc. You can refer to the user created Steam mod guide for ways to further enhance the experience! There’s also a co-op mode through the main story. It’s not supported officially, but can still be used by creating your own network using Hamachi or similar programs. I’ve yet to try this out for myself.  At the end of the day, System Shock 2 is better than ever and I’m so pleased that one of my favourite games has finally made it to Steam. If you like sci-fi RPGs, give it a go. If you like Bioshock, you should already have played this :P ",1,0

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who has friends that are up to have a lot of fun and pull all nighters or just someone that likes their adrenaline going through their body. BUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTTTTTT keep in mind, this game is not finished. There are numerous of bugs through out the game. ALTHOUGH, sometimes it really isnt a bug, theres something in the game called 'insanity stages' that makes your game seem all buggy and stuff but really its not. It's the game messing with you. But yeah there is still a lot of bugs. so if your not patient, i dont recommend this game. just wait for it to be dont but other than that, this game is pretty underrated for how well this is.

I finally booted it up just to get to the achievement (which you actually have to level your character a long way to get), and it turns out this game is fun as hell! I'm not usually into Tower Defense games, but this puts a bit of a spin on it by also dropping you into the middle of the action for some 1-on-1 combat alongside your towers. There's tons of loot, a really great levelling system, and fantastic visuals with great use of color and eye-popping cartoony designs. I think the ONLY drawback to this game is that the camera angle can only be rotated, and sometimes you really wish you could alter the vertical axis as well.

You can tell it's definitely an indie game. The generic sort of indie game; The horror isn't scary, the missions are so disjointed, even the start off is too inane and nonlinear. I get that you're supposed to not know where you are or why your there, but the establishment of the story is as I said, disjointed, and is easily not established (I've even had to restart the game on account of not knowing the beginning establishing expositions till somewhere in the middle progress of the game. Wasn't till the climax did I finally find out what I should have known in the beginning of it). Classic rookie-bland indie game, through and through. I got bored with this game. I can see how it could get potentially fun'ish, but only in game play and playthrough. In story, development, exposition, and progression, it was all mentally dull. Not captivating, nor all much interesting. I might give it a shot, but I'll wait till I'm bored enough to try again. I'd hate for my friend's efforts to go to complete wastes.",-1,0

Welcome to Far Cry 3, a world where very young teenage boys with a fetish for extreme sports go skydiving into dangerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥-murderer badlands of genocidal pirates for no good reason other than the sheer ♥♥♥♥-offness of it all! RIGHT ON!  Experience random party-animal tribals with a fetish for tattooing strangers, a land where every one is a super model, where every man is a guerilla warrior and where everyone leaves the keys in their cars all over the place.  *Spoiler* Meeting the protagonist. Jason - a young adult with the voice of a tender 13 year Californian. A boy.. err man, with a heart of steel who readily forgets grievious losses to his closest family and despite having a discomfort for blood and killing, will progress within 25 minutes of game time into the MOST RUTHLESS KILLER KNOWN TO MAN! Watch him as he butchers regiments of hardened guerilla fighters/rapists with nothing but a machete, committing mass slaughter on native wildlife because someone told him to and he doesn't have the logic to question why.   PROS + Lush environment. + Better than average graphics + Able to drive vehicles  CONS - The storyline doesnt make much sense (Protagonist suffers great tragedy and goes mast climbing, pig hunting and racing other islanders within 17 minutes of loss). - The acting is horrendous and disproportionate with the storyline. - The NPCs don't look very realistic. - The bad guys are same-ish. - The beginning of the game was the most unempowering I've witnessed in some years. - Extremely messy looking crafting system. - Information overloading at the start of the game with menus, tips, crafting needs and the like. - Exhausting repitition of resource harvesting. - Weak AI.

1035880,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Rome 2 was a horrible game when it released.

Now that it has received almost 20 patches and is finally fixed it is no longer one of the worst games ever released - it is merely the worst Total War game ever released.  What I like: The graphics  What I dislike: Literally everything else. The 'politics system' is neither politics nor a system, it's a broken idea that doesn't do anything. You can go through an entire game without ever opening the politics tab and you won't notice. The music is bland and boring and doesn't bring the game to life like in Rome 1, Medieval 2 or Shogun 2. No family tree, making important people within your empire faceless, nameless and pointless. Generals and important people in your realm are non-entities. In previous Total War games losing a beloved faction leader or general could break your heart. In Rome 2 there are no beloved faction leaders or generals and when you do lose one they are instantly replaced by some other faceless non-entity.  The list of things this game got wrong is almost endless. I find it impossible to become immersed in its setting, I feel nothing when playing it. I've tried very hard to like it as I spent £34.99 on it and have been a fan of Total War since the days of Medieval 1, but I simply can't. It is truly horrible. ",-1,0

Pros -  - Has class change system (many roles on a single character)  - Contains a mostly single-player story for those who like to play solo  - Is an MMO and has co-operative so you can play with others  - Has some PVP for those who enjoy it  - Graphics are really good  Cons -  - Crafting and scavenging is extremely repetitive  - Leveling your character can get repetitive (at certain levels, you grind specific tasks)  - Inventory system has two separate inventories, which felt clunky.  - Overall, an unrewarding experience   I got this game because a buddy of mine was playing it and I also played Final Fantasy 11 and enjoyed that. So, I purchased the orignal game and put time into the free 30 days that I received. After playing most of that, I feel like I spent most of my time doing menial tasks over and over again.

The dialogues amongst other robots are humorous in the sense they talk just like robots, yet they're asking basic questions most NPCs would ask. I wasn't a huge fan of the flashlight to find things, as you had to search every single spot or you might miss something. The storyline itself is interesting and    I can't wait to see what the Fall 2 will have to offer.

Unlike older RTS games, the Company of Heroes series puts emphasis on combined arms tactics and keeping your troops alive vice the old 'build a bunch of stuff and throw it in a meat grinder' method of 90s games. Cover grants troops defensive bonuses and can mean the difference of winning or losing small skirmishes.  There are a some changes from the original COH in that there are less chokepoint-like maps and more open terrain. However, the map editor that is bundled with the game is seeing a lot of the original maps ported over. Some fans of the original are also unhappy with the DLC that is being release, but the majority of it is cosmetic - vehicle skins, decorative name plates. The commanders can change things up as no single commander has access to all perks. However, Relic appears to be tweaking balance as time goes on to prevent overpowered units and tactics.",1,0

5646259,449140,Istrolid,"  Istrolid is one of the best free games I have ever played. It is a Space RTS where you pit your custom made fleet against anothers. Balance a fleet of fighters, Anti-missile, artilary, cruisers, dreadnaughts, anything in between and more as you design each ship yourself. What truely sets it apart is the ability to give ships their own ai. Not only design each ship, but design how it fights allowing you to focus on other things.  Pros: -Very open but balanced ship creation,  -Every item has pros and cons that actually carry meaningful weight. -Plenty of players and lobbies -Infinite strategies to try -Easy ai design for the less programming savvy -Simple, but attractive graphics -Simple gameplay that allows simple to advanced strategies for all players. -Can play against dozens of unique AI fleets instead of other players. -Can play with teams upto 3, can be mixed with AI as well.   Cons: -Nothing forces a player to finish a game, making some matches anti-climatic. -Slighty buggy here and there, nothing game breaking. -Over simplified ai design hinders those who want more depth in their ai. -Map backgrounds are simple and a little bare. -One game type. -your statistics aren't tracked for online play. -The only restriction in ship creation is that it has to costs under $1000.   How a Match looks like: You start with $2000 to spawn the ships you want(or let the ai you made do that). Your goal is to capture every point on the map. Over time each point you own gives you more money to buy more ships. Mix defensive giants, small fighters, long range beams, artillary, lasers, support ships, and others to over come your opponent and capture the points. It can be very fast paced, or slowed paced depending on strategies. Ive had half hour matches, and others that lasted a few seconds.   Overall: 9/10  Simple but diverse game that leaves you tweaking your strategies for hours. The few minor nitpicks should not stop you from trying the game out.",1,0

4623462,355800,Space Run Galaxy,"I am a big fan of this game. It ticks all of my 'addictive enjoyment' buttons... bathroom breaks are about all I made time for during the first couple of days play. I imagine my compulsive playing will simmer down to an hour here and there in future... and my personal hygeine may recover.  This game is a hex based ship building game where the preservation of your ship, your defences and your cargo is the goal (some similarity to the board game Galaxy trucker). The ship layout is followed by cargo placement, and subsequent tower defence elements requiring you to stave of waves of asteroids, enemies and creatures all trying to beat you up for your tasty tasty random ♥♥♥♥.   Things I love:   Designing and optimising your ship layout   Unlocking new weapons, defences and modules and gradually incorporating them into your strategy and (ever larger) ships   Good difficulty curve – harder enemies and harder cargo introduced at a decent pace   Reactive gameplay – there is some randomisation in missions which mean you need to focus your structures where the attacks come from (primarily two directions)   Failing a mission is not the end of the world. You never lose material resources, you just receive a smaller reward and may have to perform the run again   Allows for short session play. A mission can be paused and lasts 5-10 minutes (really hard ones you repeatedly fail can take quite a lot longer)   There is an in-game story. Nothing amazing but should make you smirk.   Things I think some people will dislike:   Repetitive gameplay: So far I've been enjoying myself and the slowly increasing difficulty but it could become grindy.   Partial randomisation: This can make some missions and ship configurations very hard to beat. If you get a wave you can't deal with in the first 30 seconds you can (and probably should) start again - but being able to adapt to everything thrown at you is the aim (or upgrade/redesign your ship).   Destroyed by a hard enemy (just before you finish the mission): I don't mind this as i enjoy learning, rethinking and eventually winning – however the first couple of times you're completely destroyed by some random nasty do cause some unfettered swearing.   Forgetfulness: Sometimes you're destroyed simply because you forgot to reconfigure a particular weapon – however the provided in-game information on upcoming waves is very clear so it's all down to you (and how overwhelmed you are).   Things I dislike:   Building the wrong module (can happen a lot if you press the wrong key combination in your haste) means you use up the limited supply as well as resources to build. if there was a 5-10 second window where you could reclaim the erroneously built module it would prevent a lot of mission restarts.   Clicking on a module to activate the special ability brings up windows that block your view of the ship. This can make targeting and watching health bars difficult.   Missions occasionally crash after completion – I chalk this up to new game teething problems. Still happens occasionally.   Being unable to target a particular area on a ship. The auto targeting is mostly pretty good – for small one-hit-kill mobs your weapons will alternate targets to avoid wastage. Unfortunately for larger vessels you weapons may target irrelevant parts which you can't prevent. The ability to assign a priority target by clicking (should you wish to) it would alleviate this gripe.   I formed my   addiction   opinions during the pre-release and at that time had no issues playing. There are still occasional problems with the online version, but they are infrequent and the multiplayer world does add to the game. (there is an offline mode)  TLDR:   Awesome game   Hugely addictive (and fun)   You'll have to put up with a few problems with the online game, but they are mostly fixed and will only improve with the attention the devs are giving it.

4350459,333930,Dirty Bomb,"This game isn't pull your hair out and scream on the floor frustrating, but it is disappointing none the less. The shooting mechanics and HUD are nice, and that's about it. All the mercs basically do one or two of four things; heal, drop ammo, push the objective, or just kill other players more effectively. Other than that, all mercs feel fundementally the same. And when all mercs feel the same, why should you buy more? And if you aren't excited to buy and try more, what is even there to look forward to in the game? Progressing your loadout cards gives you such slight advantage there's really no point in putting a ton of hours in. I understand you want a fair balanced game of skill and teamwork, but if I were to put 500+ hours in this game, I want to DESTROY the noobs who just started. There's really just no incentive to keep playing and progressing your roster unless you're in love with the same game and same mercs and could play it over again 1,000 times.

There is absolutely no control over what the game decides to throw your way, sometimes you get ridiculously easy levels, sometimes literally impossible ones. The game is fine for the first round, but after you 'loop' the game it drops the ball completely.  Having spent over 100 hours in this game, all I can say is last 50 hours of that I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off trying to endure the bs the game throws at you. If you do get the game, don't bother with the looping, it's a waste of your time. There's also an entire game mechanic (crowns) dedicated to making the game even harder than it is, which I'm sure the 0.001% of the playerbase who find the game too easy will appreciate greatly.  A similar game that does everything better is Enter the Gungeon. Both are very hard games, but in Gungeon the difficulty is fair and you can learn to overcome whatever it throws at you.

There is enough going on in Doom so that it's not repetitive and never gets stale- side challenges, weapon modification, hidden secrets, story exposition...just the right amount of each, and believe it or not, one does get a strong sense of the character of the protagonist.

722681,207350,Ys Origin,"It's a very linear game and the plot is pretty unoriginal, but executed well enough to make me feel emotionally invested in the later boss battles. Each level is a 3D puzzle platformer full of hacking and slashing. Many of the later boss battles become like shoot-em-up/bullet hell games, except that you A: fight melee (if you choose the melee character, which I did), and B: can jump over the bullets. Each boss requires a nuanced combination of strategies.  The RPG elements are pretty minimal, and the XP system is such that you can't grind ahead of the area's level, but you always catch up the area's level before you reach the boss, even if you try to avoid enemies. IMO that's a pretty good thing, since it means that there is nothing to distract you from the meat of the gameplay. (It is vital that you find all of the hidden items, though, at least on hard mode).  Also, while the environments are kinda simple, some of the shader effects look pretty good, the character portrait and sprite art are beautiful, and special effects for character and boss attacks are completely ridiculous (but totally interactive and quite sophisticated; pretty much no scripted execution nonsense).  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the music is fantastic. I still regularly listen to the soundtrack.",1,0

Every five areas, you get chest drops which can give you money, buffs or more powerful equipment. There are even side missions for your crusaders that aren't marching with your current scenario. And, once you get so far in to the game, you can also add 'talents' in to the mix to make your formation even more powerful. Of course, if you're impatient (and don't mind spending cash), there's the P2W (Pay to Win) component.  Mostly, I like it because it's pretty mindless, and easy to play with (or just leave in the background) while you're doing other things.

Whilst the game borrows from the lore of Civilization Beyond Earth the game itself doesn't hold much in common.  The game works by having you perform missions at each planet you stop at. Complete the mission and your influence on that planet rises till you control it. When you control it you can improve it, gain resources and wonders, and generally have access to more 'stuff'.  The strategy comes in utilising your fleet (you only have one) to your benefit. You only have a certain number of actions per turn so make sure you choose well. Do you do a mission on a nearby planet? Make a run for an emey's home world? Or spend a turn to repair and make new ships in your fleet?  Overall a really good game that ties 'tried and true' Sid Meier concepts into the one game.",1,1

This game has the best story I have ever experienced in a video game, so I have to highly recommend it. The pixel art is lovely and the music is sublime.  The only fault (and not a small one): There isn't much gameplay to be found. A few adventure-game type puzzles or at the very least some more dialog choices would have made this beautiful game more engaging.",1,0

549960,203160,Tomb Raider,This game is pretty good and the graphics are nice. You can make the game easier or harder depending on how often you use your 'survivor skill' or whatever it was called. The combat is a little simple by mashing buttons you can usually win although running out of amo is a very likely thing which was good. I would recomend the originals specifically number two or anniversery if you want some good puzzles but this game if you want graphics and some easter egg type hunts. Overall it was worth buying I got many hours out of it.,1,0

4784275,366220,Wurm Unlimited,"Wurm is one of the hidden gems of a game that you can escape into and forget the faces of your loved ones. It's less 'sandbox' or 'survival' and more of a Frontier. You have a pure world around you to sculpt as you see fit. Is that hill blocking your view outside your window? Grab a shovel and dig away. Want to love up someplace high? Grab a pickaxe and head up that mountain and carve out your terraced home. Think that river should curve east instead of going west? You get the idea. The terrain is 3D (no blocks) and can be shaped as the player wishes. The crafting system is a huge seller for this game. You have to craft everything in the game, swords, bows, homes, nails, boats, wagons, shoes, ovens, boxes, kegs, keel beams, saddles, roads, walls, alters, etc. The game uses material type and weight in its crafting as well as a lot of different crafting/processing methods. You mostly build components to things, like hilts, nails, beams, chain links, shafts, then combine them in order to create items. You can then improve upon them by polishing, tempering, or other methods in order to improve its quality. While there is a small 'tier' system to building materials (stone-&gt;iron-steel) for most thing the important thing is the Quality of the item. Quality will define an item's effectiveness while Material will alter is decay rate. There are a ton of skills in this game. Crafting wise you have Blacksmithing (tools), weapon smithing, armor smithing, fletching, jewelry smithing, smelting, leatherworking, cooking, boast building, house building, fences, roads, etc. Combat has, but is not limited to swords, maces, archery, polearms, greatswords, shields, scythes, etc. There is also a Religion system that can offer you bonuses and even unlocks the ability to become a Priest, giving you Magic at the cost of voluntary restrictions on what you can do. Food is very important in this game, you not only need to keep yourself feed and watered you must ensure you are eating nutritional food. To help with this you can farm, fish, keep herds of animals, all you help you cook, make cheese, cakes, wine, stews, etc. All in all Wurm has about the most robust crafting and freedom of any game you're going to fine. If you happen find something else feel free to drop me a line.",1,0

They say that for every $ you pay for a game, you should get 1 hours of playtime that you enjoy out of it. I've gotten that more than 10 times over.  Then fun thing with this game is not that you just play soccer or basketball, the fun is when you continuesly try to become better and doing things in the game. You always thrive for perfection, and it's a great feeling in this game. Whether it is becoming a better goaltender or a pro at aerials.

3123516,265690,NaissanceE,"This is a Gorgeous Monochrome (for the most part) game that will polarize players. It's basically a First-Person Exploration game - very little interaction is needed (beyond a breathing component while running, which is a great way to keep players invested when moving long distances, which you will do a lot). If you're not up for enjoying intricate and massive vistas, you'll probably get bored with this. But if you can enjoy a game just for the spaces and environments, this is a great example of the form. It gets a bit trippy in the middle, and you can definitely die (from falling mostly, or occasionally getting crushed), and you can get lost or stuck in loops. But if you just want to go to new worlds, this game has you covered. And I would love to see this in VR form.",1,0

5870893,500,Left 4 Dead,"This game is in many ways very much like other first person shooters, it has guns, a melee attack, zombies, but what other games lack is the fun! I've played COD before and it was meh, i've played Halo before and it was okay, but this game just has something that the other games don't. There are 3 major modes that i'll try to summerize quickly, survival where you fight a massive hoard of zombies (it's very hard), campaign where you play through the story, split up into different sections (this one can be single player for all you loners), and my favorite, versus where you play through the campaign but you can be 'special infected' which are a species of zombie that are harder and have more powers than the normal ones. (you can pick if you want to be infected or a survivor) To sum it all up:  Pros: -Plenty of chapters -Online or single player -Create friend only servers easily -3 fresh and fun campaigns -Choice of difficulty -Special infected make the game more interesting -hidden items and large maps -active servers  Cons: -Not many weapons -Chapters can take too long -Single player isn't that fun  9/10",1,0

They take characters from various fairy tales and put them in the 'real' modern world and make it work. To be honest, I had to be goaded into playing it. I am very glad I did. This made The Walking Dead seem weak in comparison. There is no action, just a story. A great story. I cannot discuss that story without giving any of it away so...

They paid careful attetion to what put off the players in the original game and improved the game all around. - There is a Tutorial - There are many more units - Orbital gameplay is much more interesting - Also TITANS!

This game also introduced a lot more side missions which means…. You will be doing a lot of pacing back and forth, if you like that. It’s really easy to have mixed feelings about this game, but they definitely improved on a lot of shooter elements that human revolution did not have.

Once you get into the groove of this game you can't get out. It pulls you in and you wont want to leave! With a large amount of levels that increase the speed of the stick figures on your screen as you do good, gives you challenge! If you don't do that well and fail a round, don't worry! The next time you try a stage it will be slower! If you're looking for a challenge look no further! One more thing, the soundtrack in this is great, it fits perfectly to what you are doing!  Pros:  1. Great game even if you don't have time to play!  2. For a game that's only around 5 bucks, it has smooth gameplay and no lag!  3. This game, while playing it will make you feel good about yourself while decimating stick figures!  4. All you have to do is left click and right click! It's just that simple.  Cons:  1.

4128527,319630,Life is Strange™,"LIFE IS STRANGE - A HEARTFELT REVIEW  “The value of things isn’t in the time they last, but in the intensity with which they happen. That’s why there are unforgettable moments, unexplainable things and incomparable people.”  - Fernando Pessoa   Life is, for all accounts and above all else, strange. One day I’m minding my own business, living the day just like I live any other, and next I’m wondering when they’ll legalize marriage to videogames. The difference is made by none other than this particular game, a journey across places of my mind and soul that I didn’t know existed. When I first started it, I didn’t want to let it go. Now, I don’t want it to let go of me. As I look upon a LiS wallpaper, unlock the device to browse the LiS subreddit just before going for run while listening to the LiS soundtrack and thinking about Episode 5 theories, I realize that, like Silent Hill says, this game played me just as much as I played it. Of course, I could go on about all the pros of the game with an exhaustive list. The beautiful painting-like scenarios, the atmospheric lightning, the intoxicating plot, the absolutely brilliant soundtrack, and so on. However, that is a pointless exercise because the game is simply good. Instead, I will tell you what is truly unique about Life is Strange: how it makes you feel.  It overwhelms you. It has you up at night, thinking about the choices you made. If you have the power to go back in time, how can anything not be your fault? You could have done it better; you had a gift to do so. Instead of solace, you find an insurmountable regret. The characters feel real, their world is yours, and you get in so deep that you don’t know who you are.  Eventually the episode ends. The credits roll, the trailer of the next one pops up, back to business as usual. Except you don’t forget about what happened. You are actually a difference person from when you started it, because your emotional self was pushed beyond boundaries it never even dared to look upon.  And then, when they ask you what makes this game good, you don’t know what to say. You try to write some crappy review because you want to share it with the world, but you don’t know what to say. You can think, scavenge good reasons each time in an endless effort. But in the end, the game is in your heart. It reached out to you in a way no other media form could. So you try to dismantle it, to comprehend it, only to be staggered by how much of it you carry within you. You don't love the game because it's good, it's good because you love it.  So you lean back, play the soundtrack and are taken back to the respective cutscene during which the song plays, project it to the world, and wonder just how much this game means to you. Just how much of Life Is Strange. ",1,0

It has lousy support and a no apology stance towards its customer base; a company which doesn't fear bad press is one which will never achieve greatness. While the publisher isn't at fault, so I cannot say do not buy so-and-so game, it is the developers who have chosen content over playability. My copy of the game works great - however, already one friend cannot play the game and I have yet to hear back from other friends as of yet. These are people who play far more technical games fine, just for Magicka to not take streamlining and optimization seriously.

The ground combat is pretty similar to the Arkham games, though it's not as good, it's still pretty solid. The vehicle combat is probably the best part of the game for me, going after convoys is always a lot of fun.   The PC port of this game is very well done, I'm able to max the game out at 1080p and get anywhere from 40-60fps on a single GTX 660, which impressed me a lot given how great the game looks. SLI performance, unfortunately, is pretty bad. I only get a 5fps increase in performance when I turn on my second 660 and the game tends to stutter a bit with SLI enabled as well.   Overall I would say the game is very fun and is absolutely worth getting. 8/10 would witness again.",1,0

6019739,570,Dota 2,"I can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is Dota2. But I will say the following generic things:  Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with 'tools', every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this.  What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these 'options' baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character 'should' be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun.  Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2.   Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.",1,0

If you need a break from action to clear your mind and make some friends, this is a great game for you. Don't expect any survival elements, just a relaxing experience full of adventure.  If you're curious on an encounter you might have, let me tell you about my amazing adventure:  I entered the world as a frog, having been shown the basics of the game while still a badger cub, I decided to explore the world on my own. While I did find various treasures, I couldn't unlock the rune stones on my own. With nobody near me, I decided it best to just lay by a stone and wait. After a few minutes I checked the map and noticed a lone blip near-by. I figured they would be having the same lonely troubles as me and rushed to meet them. I stumbled across a rabbit and we greeted eachother before I led them to the two runes. He followed me as I attempted to meet up with some other animals, having realized the importance of a group. The rabbit, I called him Robbs, and I joined a rather full group and had a great time exploring. Robbs and my unlockabes were fairly synced, so we got our emotes and skins at the same time. Our signature emote was the tongue-out one, which we would sometimes flash at eachother. When the skin change came, I was a little nervous because I was the only frog in the group, so it wasn't that bad that I changed to red, but there were now two white rabbits in the group, so it was a bit difficult to keep track of Robbs. When it came time to swim, I was faster than Robbs, but made sure to never leave him behind and he returned the favor on land, always being sure I didn't lag behind the group. We even split off from the group to gather a gem and some flowers before running back. All in all, I had an amazing experience and was sad when the next skin change came and Robbs bid us farewell. I don't think I'll ever meet someone as great as that bunny and it'll be hard to use the tongue emote again.  If you're out there my white, cotton-tailed friend, know that you showed this little, red frog an amazing experience that she won't forget. :P",1,0

The only thing wrong in that game was the fighting mechanic, but seriously, this game is even worse. Why can we only be a lion? What about a tiger, or a leopard? Hell, why not even the Predator himself? That's the reason I bought this game. Can we please get a decent simulator that isn't a ripoff of Goat Simulator? If you're looking for a game where you play as a predator, this isn't the one to buy. I might've thought this might've been that mobile game where you could play as animals from Africa and dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, etc. But no, of course it wasn't...

4918702,379720,DOOM,"Despite being bored with the MP Beta before release, the SP campaign for this game is fantastic. After 12 years, this game was worth the wait. Gone are the slow-moving, dark shadows of Doom 3: Where that game was a horror game with action elements, this is the complete opposite - This take on Doom is brutal, bloody, brightly-colored, and otherwise a chaotic gore-fest deluxe.  The Good: 1. Awesome graphics - blood runs out of the walls, clouds of smoke rise from destructed building on the horizon, great glass and DOF effects, etc. 2. Action, action, action, and more action - the game never stops moving. 3. Glory Kills to finish off opponents in completely blood-drenched fashion 4. All the classic Doom weapns make an appearance, are fully upgradable, and there are even a couple new ones 5. The Demons have all been revamped, and are more aggressive and deadly. Imps now climb walls and hurl fireballs at you from all sort of angles. Hell Knights will jump up to ledges to pursue you, etc. And there is no shortage of any of them. 6. Secrets galore and areas to explore 7. Minor RPG upgrading elements on gameplay and the marine's suit 8. Double jumps and climbing allows for more expanded environments and movement 9. Demons react when being damaged - they will stumble or step backward from machine gun fire, etc instead of just charging forward like a robot 10. Smooth as silk on Ultra settings (GTX 980, i5 OC to 4.3 GHZ).  The Bad: 1. Checkpoints....need I say more? 2. The maps are somtimes confusing and it's difficult to figure out where you are at a lot of the time 3. The music, while fitting to the game, is sometimes a little repetitive 4. One type of Demon is missing from the game, but was replaced with another similar one - diehards might not like this.  The Ugly: 1. For those who suffer from motion sickness, repeated Glory Kills will catch up to you.  In the same ways that the original Doom had minor aspects of Wolfentstein in it, this version reminds me of the more recent Wolfenstein games and has minor similarities to those also.   I couldn't put it down, I never lost interest, and it never got boring.  All in all, it's a killer game.  666/10 A+",1,0

I made a match with basically every mode put into it with max bots and balls, if that's not chaotic, what is? :P     The Game seams pretty simplistic but is so suprisingly fun, it REALLY deserves more attraction and a higher playerbase (it has a good amount of players, but more never hurts). and the fact the dev is continously supporting this great game and is helping the community wherever possible is something waaaay too rarely seen nowadays.

1887918,232430,Gone Home,"Playing 'Gone Home' reminded me why I love video games so much.  It is a brilliant piece of storytelling that could only be achieved through video games. Sure, the story isn't exactly one we haven't heard before and, when you consider current events going on both within and outside of the games industry, you could say the writers were going after low-hanging fruit. However, it is very well written and presented. The range of emotions one experiences when actually being in the protagonist's shoes is what makes 'Gone Home' an unforgettable experience that can't be matched by any other medium.  I will admit the game is certainly not for everyone, as it merely involves you wandering around a house searching for clues. Much of the story is told through reading and observing said clues, sometimes accompanied by some well voice-acted narration and a solid soundtrack. But the joy of the game really lies in the discovery of the events that took place in and around the home, through the slow trickle of information that occurs as you go from room to room, checking every nook and cranny. The environments are well designed, using subtle cues to guide you through the house to the next clue, making sure you never get stuck.  The game is short, it can be completed in only a handful of hours, but I personally find it to be just the right length for the kind of game it is. As much as I enjoyed my experience with it, it's not one that should be dragged out for too long. And, once you're done, there's no real reason to play through it again other than for the same reasons you'd want to rewatch a favourite movie.  Yet even so, I highly reccomend 'Gone Home' to any gamer with an open mind and looking for something a little different. But if you're the type who thinks a game isn't a game unless it has explosions and shooting and dragons, best look elsewhere.",1,0

2995703,260230,Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™,"Fantastic game. I really like how it displayed all of the different branches of the war effort. Like the Indian Army and the Canadians during Vimy Ridge. And it didn't colour the Germans as totally evil. The grunts were just guys who had to go to war just like everyone else. There's a section in the game that perfectly illustrates the idea that past the countries and nationalism, these are just people.   The characters were great, While the characters actually talk to each other, they're all very emotive and can express what they're feeling to each other. There are letters in the game that give us a behind the scenes of what each character is thinking about during certain parts of the war. There's Emile the tired grandfather and father, Karl the desperate husband and father, Freddie a man about revenge, Anna the caring daughter and Walt the faithful and loyal dog. Such great characters that are all tied together through love and longing of family. Love and friendship are such a huge part of this game.  The story was very depressing but also appropriate given the material. World War 1 was a very bloody war. There are instances of levity during the game where the game has car chases that have classic music playing in the background. Overal I thought Ubisoft Montpellier showed a lot of care and love with the game and the history involved as there's extensive material that you can read up within the game whenever picking up collectables.   The comic book visuals aping Franco-Belgian art gave me serious Tin Tin and Asterix &amp; Obelix vibes. It's a beautiful game and Ubiart continues to impress.  If there's one thing I didn't like it's the rhythm game sections in which you're healing injured but they were thankfully only used with Anna.   Anyway I highly recommend everyone play this game. There's nothing really quite like it.",1,0

1433271,221380,Age of Empires II (2013),"A HD revival of the classic Real-Time Strategy game Age of Empires II: Age of Kings and it's expansion The Conquerors. Originally released 14 years ago during the golden age of Microsoft Game Studios with classics such as Halo, Rise of Nations, Dungeon Siege, Fable etc. Age of Empires II might be the most acclaimed RTS game of all time, with exceptions of maybe Starcraft and Warcraft due to the importance they had in the competetive scene compared to Age of Empires. Age of Empires never were a real successful tournament title but there has always been small communities surviving throughout the years.  The original game is still available in some Retail stores as 'classic' branded title, often as a third-party release. I bought a DVD copy a few years ago just for the sake of nostalgia, it featured both the 1997 original Age of Empires and the sequel for 9,99€. Yet I instant-purchased AOE2HD when it arrived on Steam. I would've bought it even if it costed me 29,99€ for the sake of getting it on Steam with workshop support, achievements and higher resolutions.  The HD version does not include Any high-definition textures or effects, as one might expect. The game is rather a High resolution edition, supporting up to multi-monitor resolutions, not that it's recommended on a Strategy game, but still neat. Some people argue that the price is too high and the title is false marketing since the game does not feature any HD changes to the textures. Combine that with the amount of issues some people had upon relaese - and you get quite a few disappointed customers.  This game introduced me to Video Games, Age of Empires (1997) was the first game I ever played, at least that's what I remember. The sequel did play an even bigger role throughout my childhood and even up to this date. A supreme LAN title to play with your friends or on your High-schools computer's. No doubt this is the game I have played the most ever. Which does say quite a lot, I regularly return to play some Single or Multiplayer.  Age of Empires II HD recently recieved it's first expansion - The Forgotten. Which adds 5 new Civilizations, 4 new campaigns, a bunch of more units and upgrades, new custom maps and settings. This is probably what fans wanted with the original HD release, since the expansion costs 9,99€ alone. I am still extremely excited for new official content after such a long time!  If you do not have a personal connection to this game then I suggest checking out some videos and maybe look out for a sale. If I were to install the game from my DVD and gotten the fan created high-res support as well as server hosting service (Voobly, GameRanger), then if I would've tried to play online - I would have gotten my ♥♥♥ kicked. This revival resulted in a lot of beginners started playing this game again, which is a very good thing. I get to kick some ♥♥♥ without being a total 'AOE2 Master'. We've seen a lot of classics being revived lately, and I hope publishers and devlopers realise what kind of money a person is ready to spend just to feel like a kid again.   Like Real Time Strategy and don't mind a few dated looks? This game suits you like a glove. Maybe you just want it for the nostalgia? ",1,0

3836395,302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"Ryse: Son of Rome  Summary: Fantastic visuals, top-notch voice work and a good script make for an interesting adventure. Albeit, one let down by solid yet repetitive gameplay.  The first thing that needs to be said here is that this game looks stunning. If you’re after something to show off just how pretty modern graphics can be look no further. From fantastically animated characters to epic vistas of Rome, Ryse delivers the visual goods.  The story is also pretty good. While not exactly historically accurate to its source material (the real Nero died at the age of 30, and there was certainly never any attack on Rome by the Iceni...) it still makes good use of the general theme to produce colourful and interesting setting. Add to this that the voice acting is top notch and the script writing refreshingly frank and it all adds up to a pretty good framework for the game.  Sadly, where Ryse falls down is the actual gameplay. Moment-to-moment play is basically nothing more than moving from one small group of foes to the next, and engaging in melee combat. The combat system is a modified version of that found in the Arkham games. There is no combo system but rather a tactical selection of who to attack and twitch based counter-attacks. The system holds up pretty well, however unlike the games that it clearly inspired it, Ryse’s combat fails to evolve much over the course of the game.   While there is the option to upgrade Marius’ abilities, these bonuses are mere passive tweaks to the combat. There are no new moves, special attacks or other such things of interest to mix up the repetitive nature of the game. Likewise, the foes that Marius faces over the course of the game don’t really change. You’ll find ones that occasionally offer attacks you have to dodge rather than parry, and a few have shields that make them able to soak a bit more damage. But really, they are all the same from the start to the end.  So there we have it. Ryse is a beautiful spectacle and a great tech demo of what Crytek are capable of. However, it’s hard to shake the feeling that the ‘game’ was somewhat tacked on as an afterthought. It’s a shame since the characters and setting are interesting. However, in the end, it’s all just a bit too shallow for its own good. ",-1,0

It's not perfect, not even near, but it is fun to play and it does many things right that other rogue style games have failed.  Pros: - Pure rogue style game with permadeath characters - A lot of items and variables, no two games are same - Many classes, skills, etc. - Things seems to be nicely in balance  Cons: - Graphics (but this is normal in rogue style games) - Some UI / text features are not good and there is some small bugs  Once again game is going to be awesome price / entertainment hours ratio, because almost excelent replayability value.",1,0

Pros:  - The name has Director's Cut in it, that's a plus, right? - Fantastic controls  - Decent story (I was actually immersed the first time i played through, without DLC) - Decent graphics even at low  - Many ways to achieve objectives - Side quests and objectives feel great - If this is your first time playing with the DLC, it's great.  - Wonderfully fleshed-out characters, yes, even the main character  Cons:  - There is no skip option for the DLC. If you're playing New Game+, this will irritate a LOT of people. - Ragdoll glitches may get in the way of stealth (one of my screenshots illustrates this problem) - Sometimes, things float when you grab other things underneath them. That's A-OK in my book, though. - Game rewards stealth too much  I haven't seen the bugs people are apparently complaining about, unless it's the ones I mentioned above.  Overall: It's great the first time through, but the third (possibly second) time through will tire you out a bit. Story is compelling enough, at some times immersive.",1,0

1532915,22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Ah, the good, somewhat old, Fallout 3. The best in the series, falling shortly behind Fallout 2, the god of such RPGs, in my opinion. If you care to put some time into optimizing the bugs and tweaking settings to make it run propely, this is a damn near perfect game by our beloved Bethesda. Expanding the universe of the already exciting post-nuclear America, we're shown what happens to the area surrounding Washington, D.C., called 'The Capital Wasteland'. A rather grimmy environment that is packed with creepy and eerie surroundings. There's not one moment in the wasteland where you can feel truly safe from the mole rats to the Deathclaws wanting to rip your head open with their giant fangs. Did I mention they're ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying?  Gameplay has stayed somewhat true to its predecessors, you still have the V.A.T.S. system, but it's no longer turn-based, as you'd guess. The story is not the greatest, it has never been in the Fallout franchise, but what makes up for this is all the other stuff you can do in the Capital Wasteland. There's tons of different sidequests to do, multiple unique weapons and other stuff to collect, such as the bobbleheads - which increase your stats depending on which ones you pick up. The world is giant as you would expect, about 100+ locations to discover and, potentially, loot.   Rating: 9/10",1,0

6204121,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"I tried to like this. I really, really tried. Why can't I like this? Why, after almost 350 hours in Civ 5, does more of the same not appeal to me?  1. 1 unit per tile. Hooboy. Big design choice for Civ 5, making its return in BE. Annoying at times in C5. Damned near impossible to work with in BE. The maps are smaller, which does nothing to help the system. Unit clutter is extreme with the addition of canyons and the tight maps (even on the largest shuffling around 4 units can be a major pain). The AI is still clueless as to how this system works. C5 has been out for 4 years. 4. Years. During that time Firaxis has yet to figure out how to make the AI understand one of the most important core gameplay elements. It bogs down the game until warfare just becomes a flat out tedium and not worth the trouble.  2. Smaller maps. In addition to the issues with 1UPT, the maps just aren't as impressive. Expect to be jostling sooner, over more worthless terrain, with the same blundering AI that feeds units piecemeal into the grinder. The epic scale has gone. In a game like this, epic is what it should all be about.  3. Unit design choices. This is a mixed bag, more on that later. But the...I want to say lack of forward thinking on the way units branch is frustrating as all get out most of the time. I'll take a specific example here, but it's by no means my only gripe. The supremacy branch gets a unique siege unit. Said unique siege unit has 3 range but is very slow. It needs to set up to fire. Ok, that's fine...so why does it not have the ability to perform indirect fire? Why is that not one of the upgrades for the unit? It's supposed to be one of the most powerful artillery platforms on the planet but it can't call in strikes on a unit on the other side of a forest?  4. The stripping away of information that was previously available in C5. Example: Trade routes still function pretty much the same in BE, with the exception of internal trade, which is no longer just shipping one resource (production or food) one way. Cool. So why did they remove the tool tip that demonstrates why the values are what they are and what is going in each direction? Why does the base game lack information on what a city just finished producing (something firaxis has promised to fix, but there's already a mod out for)? The loss of the strategic map, the giant charlie foxtrot that is the city screen, the lack of a simple turns til gain counter for science and  culture...why?  Was it slowing gameplay down that much?  5. The AI itself. ICS is back in full force. The AI is just as bad as ever, except the options to deal with them have been limited even more (I'll get into that later). Forcing colonies 3 tiles away from each other does nothing to stop the AI from spamming as many of them as they can, with no rhyme or reason, no particular emphasis on strategic resources or valuable terrain. Now that more cities actively slows research acquisition, it would be nice if the AI was designed to plan intelligently. The handling of promotions, of which there are now only one type (permanent bonus to strength) is ALWAYS delegated to the immediate +50 hp if an AI unit has taken any damage.  6. Diplomacy. Still as bad as ever. Remember that bit about less information? Here's an example again: One AI decided it didn't like a trade outpost next to my capital. I, having been trading with said outpost for quite some time, was surprised and upset to see a swarm of units come in and start attacking it (one at a time mind you). I went into the diplomacy screen to see if there was an option to tell said AI to leave the outpost alone. Nope. No ability to say 'I like this place and if you continue to attack it I will stop you.' The AI was no doubt surprised when I declared war, simply to protect a resource I was actively using. Oh it gets better. After butchering their expidition, the AI promptly offered me peace and one of their colonies. I hadn't even gotten a unit close that colony. I had no intention of even attacking any of their colonies. They just gave it to me.   Later in the same game another AI declared war on me without warning. This I don't mind. It's a nice surprise to finally see them take some intiative...and 1UPT combined with the small map and rubbish terrain meant their army never even attacked my colony before they got massacred. Again, almost an immediate peace offer including one of their colonies. Not a piddling 2 or 3 pop either, a full developed colony. In a war they were the aggressor in. While my army was tied up on the other side of the continent and in position to retaliate, and my reserves were doing nothing but taking defensive positions.  But it's not just those kind of issues that are so annoying about the diplomacy. It's the sheer inanity of it all. The constant jibes, denunciations, veiled threats, stupid trade offers...It breaks immersion to have to stop every other freaking turn and click through yet another snub or 1 favor for extremely rare strategic resources exchange.  Best way to improve diplomacy in BE? Look at Alpha Centauri (only comparison I will draw to that game in this review, I promise). Give us the option to IGNORE the AI. Not only did we have the option to ignore them, they had the option to ignore us. With the diplomacy system as rubbish as it is, this would be the best way to improve it. Simply turn it off.  7. The lackluster victories. A text box. A small image. Never have so many turns and expectations gone into getting so little. Again, this game should be epic. It should not end in a text box. It should not give just the option to keep going or go back to menu. Others have complained about this in relation to C5. What happened to scores and rankings and demographics and all the other stuff that could be so cool to look at once a game was finished? Why can't I see the entire map once it's over?  8. The sheer damned grind of it all. Three victories. 22 hours. If it didn't take up to a minute to process AI turns, if everything wasn't so bogged down and slow, halve that time. This game isn't engaging beyond the first 100 turns. It simply isn't. Micromanaging the same trade route over and over again. Constructing the same structures over and over again. Waiting for a wonder to be built to provide some trivial bonus and making me wonder if it was worth it. Either automating workers (which is still just as bad as C5) or micromanging them. Carefully moving units each turn so they don't get destroyed walking through miasma rather than avoiding it. Clicking next turn again, and again, and again, waiting for the victory condition to set in, all the while dealing with moronic AI, a bog down of units, a lack of information, and what basically amounts to accounting.  It simply isn't fun. It's tedium. That's all it is. Tedium. And it didn't take long for it leave a bad taste in my mouth, especially coupled with the fact that they released the game with some pretty serious bugs that should have been squashed during development.  Would I buy this game again? Not as it is. Not at full price. Hopefully they'll be able to make it more interesting with expansions, but so much of what was done to make C5 enjoyable (it was pretty bad too at release) is gone. It's a backslide.  That being said, there are a couple of positives and things I feel well done. Not going as in depth with these.  1. The unit upgrade system. Seriously. This is a cool feature. Not real well implemented in terms of upgrade choice, but cool.  2. Virtues. I really like what they did with culture. The synergies and bonuses for stacking is a neat idea, and while providing nice bonuses isn't game breaking to a huge extent (except that one virtue that gives +.2 health/building, THAT's game breaking as hell).  3. The single promotion system. Really makes keeping units alive the whole game worthwhile.  But that's about it. Do yourself a favor, wait for a sale.",-1,0

5129262,391540,Undertale,"Memetale is by far the worst game to come out in the past decade, and thats saying something considering Fallout 4 came out not too long ago, and that was a tragedy.  Undertale is an RPG that dumped all of its resources on trying to be as funny as possible instead of anything worthwhile, like graphics, gameplay, music, or even a compelling story.  Right off the bat, the graphics are so bad you can almost count the pixels. All battle sprites come in two colors: black and white, and the game doesn't even run at 60fps. The main character looks like a potato came to life and grew hair, trust me when I say you could find better artistic talent in Shrek 2 on GBA.   The gameplay is a repetitive grind, like all RPGs, it's 'stand in place and kill enemies till you level up'. To make it worse, the higher level you are the longer it takes to get in encounters, so if you actually want to get any cash income in the game you're all outta luck without investing hours upon hours of monotonous walking. Most enemies and bosses die in one to two hits anyways, so it's not like there is any purpose to the leveling, it just takes away any idea of a fight being challenging or threatening. The developer stole the 'unique' bullet-hell fighting mechanic straight from ZUN's Touhou series, blatantly ripping off the patterns with no new features added whatsoever. Whether you're a casual gamer, or hardcore bullet-hell or JRPG fan, Undertale has nothing for either audience.  Given that Toby Fox made the music for Homestuck, you can already tell the kind of uncreative music that fills the different boss fights of Undertale. Theres only about 10-12 unique song melodies in the game, with every other one being a highly distorted or remixed version of another song, god knows how many times he reused the generic enemy fight theme and rehashed it into other boss themes. Overall, the 8-bit music sounds very grating on the ears, and while they can sometimes be catchy, they rarely fit the theme or feeling of the situation they're used in.  The 'story' of Undertale can be summarized as follows (no spoilers): A human falls into a cave full of spooky monsters, and has to befriend a bunch of wacky characters if they want to get back home! Not too bad conceptually, until they start trying to stuff forced drama at every turn of the story, and every twist you can see coming from a mile away. Not to mention they interrupt any sense of 'atmosphere' the story gives off to spew some pop culture references to some kind of weeaboo anime trash or various other nerd fandoms. Most of the comedy devolves down into 'lol so randum!!xD' gags, such as throwing the word 'spaghettii!' into sentences at random, or having the mascot character dog show up and do something wacky at any given time.  If you've ever seen the character 'Temmie' from somewhere on the internet, they exemplify all that Undertale offers when it comes to writing.  The game offers around ~6 hours of gameplay, which is grossly unacceptable by today's standards for a game worth $10. Undertale is incredibly easy by all means, offering very few challenges, clearly due to the game's emphasis on writing. If you're interested in Dank Memez, this game is an easy 10/10, but for anyone looking for something else I'd advise looking towards ANY other game.",-1,1

If you've already played the later entries like Vesperia, Xillia or even that terrible Graces F then you'll probably find yourself at a disadvantage with the combat--That of which Tales usually excels at isn't that good. I personally also find the lack of voice acting for the skits to be distracting quite a bit, given voice acting exists pretty much everywhere else in the game--Sure, the game is old but so is Final Fantasy X and it had plenty of voice acting--But getting into the voice acting, I'd dare say that isn't up to standards either which only serves to highlight the game's inexorable ♥♥♥♥-dribling old age. I suppose not all old games could carry themselves quite as well in terms of voice direction as Metal Gear, ironic given the narration is being done by Liquid Snake (Cam Clarke) but I digress.  In a world where an excellent port of a great JRPG like Valkyria Chronicles exist, Symphonia plays the role of the dog poo located next to a firmly build brick-house. You'd be much better off playing that or getting the PS3 Remaster of Symphonia and then get an addiotional game in the package as well. Tales of Symphonia might be a really good game, but I dare say its age is showing and awful messy port-job does little to help justify, even warrant, it worthy as a good purchase.",-1,0

It's hard to predict the outcome of each match, now, unlike in the beta. The game's really accessible for beginners, and instead of going on a goose chase for the monster for 20 minutes like it was before, there's a lot of confrontations, a lot of action, and a ton of fun. The hunters are all fun too, not just for gameplay, but there's always chatter at the beginning of missions that makes the hunters feel more like actual people, which is really cool. I'd recommend that everyone try this game, even if you tried it before and didn't like it. I love the game and the direction it's going.",1,0

I reccomend this game over the original Men of War Assault Squad is due to the death of the multiplayer and that the single player is identical.,1,0

5014111,384320,,"I am a huge Handbal fan and have been waiting quite a long time for a good handball game. Obviously Handball 16 can not be compared to other well established sports games but I have played the entire series (HC12 and HC14) and I really feell there is a great potential.  Handball is a fun sport to play. Dynamic, spectacular and with tactical elements. Handball 16 fails to completely capture the handball atmosphere, but it is still fun to play. Graphics are ok and you have all the game modes you would expect from a sports game (league, career, offline and online exhibition). Also you have the first german, french and spanish league. There are also some danish teams but they don't have the original players I believe.  Gameplay is quite different to the previous version. The scoring system is harder and you really need to test around for a while to get the hang of it. Unfortunately there is no tutorial so it took me half a season to win my first match.   The biggest strength however is the new offense play system. You can choose from different plays and if you perfrom them correctly you are awarded with a slowmotion jump shot giving you more time to aim and making it easier to score. This is actually a lot of fun and bringst out the hnabdall feeling.  I also like the german commentators Stefan Kretzschmar and Markus Götz. It's nice to have the original voices know from TV.   So personally I would defintely recommend this game to anybody interested in handball. You will need some time to get used to it, but it is the only handball game out there and I as I definetely want this series to continue it just makes sense to support it.",1,1

Elizabeth is the star of the show and the best companion in any game ever, she is helpful in ways that seem small at first but can save you in a pinch. Combat is so fun that I feel I could get another replay out of it before I got bored. A reference to the other games in the series and 2 dlc's that brings you to rapture.  Cons: Poor ending that I won't spoil for you because there may be people who enjoy it. Small selection of guns. Loot system is out dated but at times seems a good fit to the fast paced nature of the game. Some sensitive people may flip out at the racist views of the locals of columbia, but if you think about it the only people that think that way are the people you are killing.

4429346,340000,Headlander,"  My favorite Metroidvania since Strider and it's actually a lot more like Strider than other Metroidvanias. The pacing is very fast paced and carefree since you can easily bounce between bodies. There's a few navigation puzzles, but mostly it's just about the moment to moment gameplay and stylish-as-♥♥♥♥ imagery.  A few problems: The Steam Controller aiming is painful, the first hour is a little boring, and mashers slow down the tunnel areas for no good reason. But, the flying head controls feel great and there was enough great gags between all the misfire to keep me laughing. The setting of robots desperately trying to be human with shag carpet discos is both chilling and hilarious. It's a nice touch that almost every character has its own dance.  Abilities are in a skill tree and don't unlock new areas, but do a good job of giving you new tricky ways to attack and defend. This isn't a traditional action adventure, but if you liked Strider I bet you'll like this.",1,0

1302332,220240,Far Cry® 3,"I do recommend far cry three, as an amzing fps, story dirven game. The actual story of Far Cry 3 is relatively short, and you can speed past through it. However, the game is very fleshed out and detailed (But if you want a game with a scary amount of things to do, get skyrim). I'll discuss from pros and cons i see form this game, and please remember that this is an opinion.  The actual gameplay (the feeling, the atmosphere, etc) is amazing. As i drive to my next mission, i can see tigers actually hunting ans chasing deer, i can see dogs and dingos traveling in packs. When i want to take a break, i can go play poker,or go to shooting ranges and challenges. The gun play is well balanced with the story, and so are skills. Even though the story is short you have many outposts full of pirates you need to liberate adding for things to do even after the story. As for the actual story Jason Brody really does develop as a person (for the good or bad).   There were some hiccups in the game however, but are few and far between. First, i don't enjoy the choice that jason has to make at the end of the game and i understand the aspect of trying not to follow a completely singular line, but wish the devs had choen a different option. jason started the game trying to save his friends but ensd up on a mission to kill the evil on the osland. in the end he has to choose his friends, or the natives that promise him more and more power. Also, UPlay is not as bad as everyone makes out to be, but ni have ancountered some times where it is slow becuase it has to load up, and synchronize/sav at the end of every session. I'm not sure what people don't like about it, but that is the onyl problem i have every really encountered. I'm sure something happened,b ut it wasn't important enough for me to remember.  All in all, the story is short, but sweet till the end (for me). The gameplay is great becuase it provides a realistic and beutiul/realistic atmosphere. Even though a couple things are left for want, this game is great, and i totally recommend you buy it. Thanks for reading guys. :D ",1,1

5411401,418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"I really, really wanted this game to be good. I love RWBY and after the recent decent into darkness of season 3 and the upcoming season 4, i am excited as ever for it. But this game is so bad. I can barely call it a game. I actually got this back in the Early Access days, when it was cheaper, and i can say that since then not much of the game has been improved. GAMEPLAY RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a Co-op 4 person Spectacle Beat 'em up. It has actually a great concept but was made poorly. The game has next to now actual skill needed to win, you just spam the best of like 3 combos to win. There is a counter that doesn't always work, a weird team attack system that actually took me a thrid of my first playthrough to actually figure out and honestly, i found that i could beat the game by spamming one move. The gameplay is not fun, and very repetitive, They throw in Ranks, but it resets your characters level every time you do it so it's honestly not worth it. Not to mention that there is next to now variety in the game.  STORY There is no story here. Random bad Guy Number 1 is experimenting on grimm, go stop him. That's literally it. And that is so aggravating. RWBY is a well written show, and because this game WAS made by Rooster Teeth, i have to wonder where all those writers went? Did Monty just write the entire story out for them to use, because that's kinda what this game makes me feel like. The characters have no personallity, besides the once in a while one liner or pun or sarcastic comment, which each character only has like 3 of.  GRAPHICS &amp; MUSIC The games looks are really the only thing that spring to mind about this game thats good. The game is gorgeous and colorful, but is very empty, which kills the awe of it. The music is good, but it's just a bunch of instrumental stuff from the game, which is a little frusterating. I want to hear Red Like Roses lyrics! That's some of the best part of the song  OVERALL: Really this game is mediocre at best and give me an impression of no effort, or they wanted it out as soon as possible. Honestly this game feels the same as it was in Early Access and thats what bothers me. It feels like the game is not finished and its so frusterating that it won't ever be properly finished. With the rumors of JNPR being paid DLC i can confidently say, DON'T BUY THIS GAME, for the full price. If you want a short, dumb, mindless grindy game, this is for you, just please, wait for the price tag to lower. This game is no worth $25.",-1,0

2088013,237930,Transistor,"To describe  Transistor  in just a few words simply doesn't do it justice.  When I first received  Transistor  as a gift, I was extremely picky with games. At the time, I thought I could never be immersed in a world that was isometric, and I'd never enjoy combat that was turned-based. I could never have been more wrong.  The first thing you'll notice is how gorgeous the visuals are and how immersive the voiceover is. Not long after, you should also be able to hear the magnificent soundtrack which blends beautifully into the game. The controls are very easy to learn and the combat system is wonderfully executed. The combat system is very tactical while still managing to be very action-based so you're not left feeling bored. I also find it hard to become bored with the combat system because of how many Function combinations there are and with all the Limiters available.   You'll find yourself pensive as you begin to uncover Transistor's memorable story, although it might leave you wanting to know more about the characters and their Functions, more specifically   Breach() a.k.a. Subject Not Found.    Overall,  Transistor  is a game I will always remember and cherish as I've found few other games to be comparable.

5962671,550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Best co-op Zombie shooter/horde game out there.  Tons of people that play, community very strong.  Source based game engine, means that the game runs flawlessly on lower end systems. Complete Steam features (cheivements, cards, cloud). Fully voiced characters, epic soundtrack. Great story, characters and maps. The maps in this game have such great detail reminisent of games like HL:2. Weapons and Ammo, and everything else, has to be searched for, this gives the game an exploration aspect to it, which it benefits from, as battles become tense without the right strategy.  Best way to discribe it would be is if you took Payday and merged it with a Zombie/horde shooter, teamwork is key.  Great PVE multiplayer game, you can play it solo as well!

Lower end pc owner BEWARE this game will either not run or will lag at 5 fps if your system isn't up to snuff. That being out of the way lets talk about the game, I got this on sale the other day thinking '10$ for the game and dlc great deal right?' well kinda. The poor optimization of the game for any computer kicked me hard, so I only got to play the prologue (like 5 minutes of gameplay). Then the fps went rock bottom at like 2-7 and it was unplayable, but what I saw before it all went south was worth the cost (if it ever works right). I got a good look at the skill system and all I can say is it was nice (Lot to look at and choices to make and the follower help that fact a lot). The gameplay is what you would expect from a game like torchlight so it works great. The story to me seemed to be the weakest part as right from the start it made me not really care at all. currently for my experiences with the game its a 3/10, but if i get it to work or get a new rig to play on it has an 8/10* potential.

The art style is minimilistic and excellent for this type of game, and the interface is easy to navigate and very user-friendly. I've run into a few minor bugs but nothing that was a fustration.   At the time of writing this review I'm 17 hours in and I feel like I've barely touched the surface, which is great. I bought this on sale for $15 and I defintiely got my money's worth. 10/10 would recommend",1,0

2000941,234630,Project CARS,"After several patches and new AMD drivers (15.7), the game is much more playable for me. The game no longer loses over half its frames when a single car drives in front.  I'm getting about 50-60 fps on medium/high settings. Drops down to about 30 when there's a bunch of cars and weather doing its thing.  I'm hoping that Windows 10 will improve performance even futher.  I can now recommend this game, however it had a very disappointing launch.  ***Old Review***  As an owner of an AMD GPU (7870) I can't recommend you get this game. It seems that the developer has optimized Project CARS only for nvidia hardware, comparable AMD cards under perform (R9 280s and 290s are performing worse than 660s).  If you own an AMD card, save your money until this game is fixed. If you've got an nvidia card, go for it, the game is fun.

692787,206440,To the Moon,"This game astounded me. I read the reviews before I played it, and I thought 'There's no way it can be that good.' I'm happy to say I was wrong. As most reviews will tell you, the story is what makes this game, and the story is what will make you remeber this game when your done. The story is gripping, emotional, at times hilarious, thought provoking, and very relatable. It's also very well paced. The soundtrack complements it amazingly, with music equatable to Bastion. I'm extremely happy my friend gifted me the soundtrack with the game, cause its worth the listen. If the game has a weakness (and I don't know if I can fully call it a weakness) its that it has very simple gameplay. The gameplay is very much a tool to deliver the story in this game. The graphics may seem like a weakness to some as well, but I'm actually really impressed with what they managed to achieve in a 16 bit graphical style. All in all, this game was amazing, and definitely worth the playthrough. If you ever need proof that a game is a work of art, play this game.   Overall I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10, or an A.",1,0

As you play you learn new things and little tricks to get faster making it have a high replay value especially for those people who love to climb a leaderboard. I enjoyed the music as well as the look and feel of the game even the setting of being in a childs room as his out of shape action figure. It gives it almost a Toy Story feel.

That I couldn't direct the game in the direction I *really* felt it was hinting at, yet never delivered on.

654585,205710,EverQuest Free-to-Play,Love the game.  But the company that owns the game is complete garbage. I started EQ up back in 1999 and it was much different over the years of course the game has changed sadly not for the better.  The community of the game has gone to complete ♥♥♥♥ and the company has changed their rules to make it okay for other players to basically harass you. Kill stealing is a thing because whoever does the most damage gets the exp and loot. Training (The act of grabbing a bunch of monsters and leading them onto another player with the intent to kill them) is extreamly prevalent on their new progression server. Do not go into the game alone most people box more than one character and go out of their way to screw you.  I cannot recommend the live version of Everquest anymore. World of Warcraft has a better community now.,-1,0

For instance 95 hours in and I have virtually no idea what my stats do or if my build is good. The story and the voice acting make up for everything though. I'll always remember investigating on Solomon Island, or doing missions for the statues in Cairo. This game should be better! So it can be everywhere!  Edit Feb. 2016 = I've purchased the lifetime sub before it went away, I love the story and presentation but most everything else is either passable to just terrible. The game has given me an error EVERY time I log out. Every third or so time I try to log in to the game it either get's stuck on the load screen or the program just ends.

From the story telling, to the music and sound, to the gameplay, it is one of the finest creations known. You don't like how someone is talking to you? You are not forced as a player to play along and be a good guy. You can bust out your sword, blaster, lightsaber and show them that they are ticking you off. Want to play a Dark Jedi? Balance your actions between Light and Dark side. Wanna be the Good Light Sided Jedi, help everyone! Upset that some quest giver makes you do some stupid quest that you hated and feel like you are getting shafted, shank them! That's what makes KOTOR 2 so great! Be the Jedi, Sith, or Dark Jedi and how you want to be.  [Special Note: KOTOR 2 can be modded and I highly recommend it. You can get sharper resolution out of it. Fix the Minimap if you do. In addition, there is additional content that wasn't finished by Devs that has been completed called the Sith Lords Restoration Content Mod (TSLRCM).

Like reading a good book. I always had nightmares happening in the 60, don't ask me why because I was born in 72. But the feel of the game recreate perfectly the old sci-fi movies of that time, the music, the design , the colors, everything. Like in my damn nightmares. Every 10 minutes when I was playing I told myself what a great game it is. I dont know if they will release another game of this type, its not really opened for a sequel.

The game is a large game of kingmaker, the main goal usually becoming the King of all Calradia (or Emperor), or helping a current faction to the same goal via being a vassal.  If you like large scale battles, where you yourself, are in the midst of, whether it be on an open battlefield, or a large seige. This game does it perfectly, it's hard to get tired of the battles. You'll grow to love blue colored text, and dread red.  Probably not the best review, but the game goes for $5, and there's no way i couldn't reccomend you give it a try.

5018476,385330,Stray Cat Crossing,"Pretty fun game, had some great concepts and visuals that made it worth it on that merit alone. Music was especially effective, very nice job.  My one critique is that some of the puzzles seemed to take an unnecessary amount of time. I got the thematic point of all the repetition required, but from an actual gameplay perspective it got a little tiresome, especially when I could see easy ways the issues could have been resolved. It's fine not to give clear instructions and let us figure it out, but then figuring it out became tedious. For example, the movement speed reduction during the bird bath puzzle, making us go through the play repeatedly, making us pick up the rose to get the ticket every time, making us go through that conversation with the crying Cat oooover and ooover and ooover. Some of those options should have just stayed in effect so we could move forward once completing something correctly. With the end segment especially, I was really getting annoyed and impatient.  Reminded me a small scale version of Rule of Rose, annoying game play and all.",1,0

1519716,223470,POSTAL 2,"Postal 2 is an openworld-esque game in roughly the same sense that Deus Ex is: Fairly large maps with a loading screen every now and then. It's an errand objective based game spanning across 7 days in where you do a different set of errands in (mostly) any order each day. Errands, which go incredibly wrong most of the time, and involve very much violence.  The game has an inventory system of sorts with pretty much no limit except for ammocounts, items include things such as: Healing items ranging from a simple doughnut, to an overpowered health capping drug, as well as catnip which can be used as a bullet time drug, and cats which can literally be used as shotgun silencers. There's also healthkits you can pickup and use immediately, but not carry around in your inventory. The Postal Dude would rather carry an armada of cats and enough fastfood to kill America, but not something sensible like healthkits. Absolutely no complaints here.  This has something in common with Shadow Warrior and the Jedi Knight Star Wars games, in that they both have firearms and a really awesome melee weapon(s) you use all the time because it's more effective and more fun, and tons more of decapitations.  There's tons of melee weapons, guns, and things to set on fire. If you catch on fire, you can ♥♥♥♥ in the air to put yourself out. You can also pour gasoline everywhere in funny shapes and set it on fire to display something stupid, and then set everyone on fire. And then ♥♥♥♥ it all out.  At one point I got some soldiers I rescued from a secret terrorist base to sign a petition to make whiny old congressmen play violent video games. I couldn't be any happier when this happened.  The game's feel and engine is somewhere between Half-Life and Deus Ex and something else. Old crunchy feel to the levels (but not quite that old), and the silly movement bob when you move. Except Postal Dude can take seemingly even more damage than Gordon Freeman himself. All those years of drug abuse must have weaved some sort of kevlar equivalent into his skin or something.  Also, at one point, the developers amazingly decided to release an expansion for this game 10+ years after it came out, kind of like how Age of Empires II got new DLC itself. Still can't believe either of those happened.  Game kind of runs like trash at times, especially when too many NPCs are thinking, like fighting things and just generally freaking out. I've had 2 crashes in the main game in my roughly 12 hours of playing, so the game is stable enough.  So yeah, it's a violent classic. Go buy it and cause chaos, or be a pacifist and just do errands, or something.",1,1

6261834,7610,Railroad Tycoon 3,"This gem from 2003 is a really great economic sim. It really is a tycoon adventure. Graphics are poor, but it's really fun to become filthy rich by using the map and figuring out what to do with all the resources there. Sure, you can set up a neat network of raiload between cities and make bucks by hauling goods and passengers. Or you can buy industries, using the resource map to see where raw materials come from and which route they are taking to get to any processing facility.   Maybe you can build a lumber mill in a concentration of logging camps, or you can set up a railroad to pick up those logs and haul them to an already existing lumber mill for a profit. It does matter what you do, because all resources have different prices around the map. If logs cost $ 50/unit, lumber costs $ 75/unit and overhead/salaries are $ 100 annual, and it can produce 5 lumber a year, you're barely making a profit ($ 25 a year). It might be better to invest those money in something else. Prices change though, depending on supply and demand (and global economy, which can change at random, recession - prosperity). You can issue bonds, with varying interest rate, and issue stocks etc.  Oh yeah, there are stocks in the game. Personal wealth is different from company wealth, but they compliment each other. It's a really good, intricate system of economics that's really fun to understand and use. There's not very much micromanaging, unless you want to decide what cargo your trains will haul. If not, they will haul whatever is the most profitable. It's a very fun game, and I really recommend it.  I only wish it still had a solid playerbase.",1,0

I wouldn't really take the story very seriously it's a tad bit silly here and there, especially for a medieval fantasy RPG. Character/Pawn customization is great; there are not too many limits with what you can do with them. Feels good to fight things and boss fights are pretty interesting. Your battles can't always be won by sheer willpower and no thought, you'll have to think for quite a bit of them. The Pawn system is by far one of the coolest things in this game. Basically you get to create your sworn companion and adventure with them and what not. The cool thing is, is that you can summon another players' Pawns and have them come along with you on your adventure, same thing goes for your Pawn. When they get summoned by someone they will learn things that they didn't know before (like how to kill a certain enemy). When they get sent home they will be rated by the other player, and may possibly send you a gift as well.  Overall Score: 8.5/10",1,1
5511582,43110,,"This game has a very good story line and it was a lot of fun to play as well as a challenge.

533728,203160,Tomb Raider,"I would believe Lara Croft more as the protagonist of Spec Ops: The Line than I would in Tomb Raider, her own video game. Her own video game that portrays her as a junior archeologist marooned on a mysterious island, forced to fend for herself. Her own video game, in which she expresses emotional agony over the death of a deer she must kill in order to eat in one moment, and then in another moment thirty minutes later, emotionlessly performing stealth kills and scoring headshots on unsuspecting human beings in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization on the concept of stealth gameplay. Whenever a human life with a weapon is near Lara, it's a good bet that that human life will be snuffed out through the sheer force of destruction and death that she embodies. The developers stated that in order to make the game more realistic, the body count she piles up was halved from what it originally was, but there's enough to give her a kill count comparable to the death toll of a third-world war. During one moment of the game, she screams 'You don't have to do this!' after I have already shot a bullet through some poor islander's head. The way I play these cover shooters and the way the game is trying to present Lara to me are two completely opposite things. To the game's credit, it acknowledges this dissonance, but it doesn't do anything about it. Instead, the game is encouraging me to plow through these hapless people with no option to go around them. I gotta shoot all the mans, I gotta shoot all the mans so I can defend my tribe and get off the island. Go, Lara Croft, you gotta shoot all the mans in their faces. Shooty shoot shoot. Oh, and also act vulnerable and traumatized because this is an origin story.  Oh, were you looking for a review on how the game plays? I'm sorry, let me get to that right now: It's boring cover shooter stuff with a faux-open world and boring token RPG upgrades. Have fun, nerd!",-1,0

5031215,386070,Planetary Annihilation: TITANS,"Not gonna lie i am really enjoying this game...there are a few problems to do with balancing in some areas of units, seen as they can be built so quickly early game and can end up dominating, however these units can be countered if eco has been balanced and you have built up a force to counter it. I have found that the hard difficulty AI is quiet challenging especially when they use rush tactics early on and nuke spam/zeus spam late game...but the challenge can create some intense games if looking to play on your own or with friends. In terms of chrashes; i have only experienced one crash and it ended up restarting my computer, however i think this was due to the fact i had run the game for almost a day playing with friends with up to 16 planets + an asteroid belt.  I have found this game to be one of the best ive played in my opinion, if you love rts and mass destruction, then this game is for you! Just make sure that your specs are up to the requirements cause the game can be quiet demanding when massive scale battles are taking place. Also the system designer is amazing! So far ive been able to create our solar sytem...including Saturn, it is just a shame that the asteroid belt cant be placed around planets and instead four moons took its place. Apart from that i cant wait to get importing new systems and planets and maybe getting a few mods from the old game to add to the experience!   Overall this game isnt a master piece and it is a little overpriced...especially when it already has the vanilla game from the original (which i did not have chance to play) however the newer version has just improved in almost every aspect...but it does earn a positive review from me as it is my dream game and im glad the developers listened to the feedback from the original and have followed up with a much better game experience.  Edit : Orbital combat could be more fleshed out; for example, when playing on a large system that takes 5 or 10 minutes to get to the outer planet, it is frustating if an enemy that is almost defeated (the base is destroyed but commander remaining) sends their commander to that planet just to lengthen the game when it is not needed...also the unit variety is good but there are spaces left in the factories for units which makes me wonder if the developers are still thinking of adding more units to the game to further increase the roster! Which would be greatly appreciated. Even through these flaws or design choices it is still an excellent game, with good unit variety (especially naval &lt;3), imaginative graphic design, an intuitive system designer and an overall grounded rts!

I've played many games of these space grand strategy games starting from Master of Orion back in the day and this game did the trick. Ship design is good and having to manage resources.

Takes about 20-25 hours to complete on normal.  pros: gameplay that you would expect from a diablo-inspired action RPG, level environments, soundtrack, character selection, matching PK/PVP, weapon/modifier variety, passive skill tree customization  cons: always online, no LAN &amp; offline mode, slow traveling, not enough hotkeys for spells/abilities, difficult to distinguish character classes on multiplayer, server crashes all the time so you have to run back to where you were last located with a completely new randomized map, sparse waypoints especially on act3, back tracking quests, underwhelming boss loots, final boss battle is one of the worst ive ever played, ending sucked.  Overall, I think Torchlight 2 is the better ARPG. If you enjoyed Diablo 1&amp;2 and TL 1&amp;2, then Path of Exile is your next stop with my recommendation.",1,0

5794659,48700,Mount & Blade: Warband,"Battles are fun, everything else is badly implemented. I have run into graphics glitches that cause my character to become headless and maps to become black and invisible. There is also a memory leak problem; the longer you play the game, the choppier the frame rates become. This isn't a problem affecting everyone though. Likewise the graphics glitches I mentioned also doesn't affect everyone.  Things that are fun: 1. Battles  Things that are not fun: 1. Chasing cattles 2. Chasing bandits 3. Chasing ladies 4. Chasing lords 5. Chasing spies  Boy that's a lot of chasing.  Chasing cattles, more specifically, herding them, is not a needed game mechanic. In fact, there is no reason to have cattles in the game at all; it doesn't add anything good to the game. Cattle mechanic can easily be replaced by something more fun. Chasing bandits, where the bandits are faster than you, takes forever. You have to actually corner them on the map to do these quests. The next is looking for bandit hide outs, which is equally boring. You need to be right next to a bandit hideout for it to appear on the map. You need to chase ladies and lords around for quests. You want to hand in and get quests from the ladies and lords, but the ladies and lords aren't always at the same faction or the same castle. So you actually have to ask other lords in their faction to find where they are. Sometimes they disappear and you can never find them, so that means the quest is an auto-fail. Chasing spies is another ridiculous quest. If you don't know how to chase spies, you will auto-fail the quest. To even complete the quest, you need decent tracking skill, which the game doesn't tell you.  The whole chasing problem is worsened by real time travelling. I wish they could abstract the over-map travelling, because there doesn't seem to be too many positive reason for the player to have to move across the map in real time.&nbsp;I actually don't hate moving around in real time, I just hate the combination of real time movement and chasing quests.   The next point is the lack of tutorial in the game. The only tutorial the game offers is for combat and nothing else. Everything else in the game you have to look it up on the wiki, the game forum, or learn trial by error.  The only good thing the game has going for it is the combat. If the developer improves non-combat aspects of the game, such as better quests and political interactions, this could be the best game I have ever played, but no such luck.   And yes, I still recommend this game just for the battle.",1,0

And it was... sort of fun. But the game is not good. The controls aren't tight, the hit detection is awful, and the level design makes NO sense as a 'game in reverse' - if you were playing these levels 'forward' they wouldn't work at all. It's just a platforming puzzle (and I use 'puzzle' loosely) set up to be done backwards. And the level design is uninspired, to the point where even 90% of the way into the game they're still throwing in levels with only one or two jumps / obstacles in them, no tougher than the stuff at the very beginning.  There are some promising ideas in here. But I played all the way through it not because I was having a great time, but to see if there was anything better further in. There was not.",-1,0

I love exploring every every inch of the island, it was almost like an open world Uncharted. I even liked the few platforming elements in the game (don't see that too much in FPS games anymore) I thought it was neat how each and every tower was different and run down in its own way. The characters were great except Jason who had some real cheesy lines. It had some unique missions that's for sure.

354028,13600,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,"A classic gaming adventure through time and back again, this game offers a decent storyline with an interesting gameplay.   The gameplay mainly consists of jumping and sprinting-on-walls-puzzles and killing mobs vice versa.  The puzzles were fairly straight-forward, but because of some features it felt like the difficulty of the gameplay was almost nonexistent, however throughout the game all these elements still created a nice flow to it. In conclusion if you're a hardcore player that seeks a challenge this game is probably not for you.  The most frustrating parts were the camera angles, which probably worked like a charm if you knew exactly were you're going, but if not, like me sometimes it can be a nuisance. However when no camera related issues were at hand the gameplay was very enjoyable.   Even after almost 15 years the aestetics of the game still looks very pleasing to the eye. Overall their were some wonkyness from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game imo. Bare in mind that it's also a fairly short game, but in the end still worth the 5 Euros I paid on the sale.",1,0

4842061,372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"  Before you begin reading note that most people here tested the game before it was even avaible for public, currently it's f2p and most bugs and issues have been fixed and no lag seems to affect the servers anymore, so forget about that, it's all good now, botters are also gone, Ave maria.  Cons: 1. The way I see it what matters is the experience itself and not the game's features, if you're looking for a good time with your friends, this might not be as fun as Ragnarok, and by that I mean, you don't get to stick to your friends, the questline will push you further and further into more missions rather than make you grind mobs in a group, eventually you will find yourself teleporting from map to map to complete your missions and so on, so forget about team work unless you're running a guild which is incredibly expensive or dungeons that you only get to do past level 50 twice a day.  2. If you like to play by the market and go full merchant shekelstein, go ahead, but not without premium, so forget your profit because you won't get any with a 30% tax and no currency trading or whatsoever, you can only trade items and with premium you get a 10% taxation on the market, which is still a great rip off in your profits, IMC crippled us good here.  3. Another problem you might find is leveling up, not that it's hard but you'll have a hard time figuring out when to use your exp cards and knowing what maps you should clear first, also, you must clear all maps and do all quests otherwise you stagnate late game and get stuck with no cards and no missions, you mustn't do them too late nor too early, otherwise you'll have hard time grinding less than 1% exp mobs, worst case scenario your equipment gets trashed and you are left broke with no money and no conditions to come back.  4. Unfortunately, aesthethical customization is an issue, you don't have many options besides your hair which you don't even get to choose the color, you'll have to grind mobs to get different colors, and hats are mostly either expensive and hard/impossible to get or they're so common everyone has them, very limited in my opinion, a waste for such a well detailed game. No visual diversity at all.  Pros: 1. Great characters, great animations and the music is simply amazing, it won't make your head ache and it synchronizes damn well with the map themes, the graphics are awesome and certainly drew most of the game base by it's aesthethic sense 10/10 for drawing efforts.  2. After the updates there is no lag and mostly no bugs, not sure if they fixed all classes but it's all good as far as I've gone through, the players in the brazilian server are quite friendly and will help you out, and most certainly will need your help in return sooner or later, goldsellers are unable to profit due to no silver trade and steam currency packs are now selected by server and will probably have different prices, so no more exploiting, no need to ♥♥♥♥ everyone equally like before, IMC disposes of a bad decision making team shame on them, but it's fixed for now, I hope.  3. The game simply offers you many features and builds, you'll find yourself immersed in your class, be it a full highlander glasscannon or a supporting hybrid tank heretic gypsie druid, althought some classes are useless as far as I'm concerned, you can ♥♥♥♥ up your character easily so don't go around doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ pretending to know what you're doing.  4. Just go and see for yourself, it's grindy but fun, everything about it is well done and the gameplay feels really great, the PvP is pretty fun too, the game is one of a kind, go check it out!",1,1

6322603,8870,BioShock Infinite,"Much can be said about Bioshock: Infinite ... in fact much has been said about the game. The game has been hyped to the extreme and the honest truth is that while you cannot fault the story in any way, the gameplay is lackluster and leaves something to be desired.  The good  - The game is gorgeous, although the use of particle is overdone (it's a bit odd that a place is the sky can seem so dusty). The game runs smooth even on middle of the range hardware. - Elisabeth is by far the best companion in video game history. PERIOD! - Shooting is super solid  The bad  - Prepare to get lost often, the navigation aid marks the next 10 meters or so and is only onscreen for one second (no I'm not kidding) and if you move forward while using it you will run faster than it 'paints' and you wont see it at all. so it ends up being a slow cumbersome compass whose button you keep spamming in a 'press the button, move 20 meters' rinse and repeat kind of way. On top of that in large areas it often points to the skyline system, which is horrible because the is no indication of where you need to get off the skyline. You end up having to jump off the skyline and hitting navigation function, only to find that it points back to the skyline. Trial and error becomes the prefered tactic.   - Early in the you have access to standard weaponry such as shotguns, rpgs, snipers etc. The guns that becomes available later in the game are in a way upgrades of the earlier guns availble. But these guns seems underpowered and sometimes downright useless. The shotgun replacement becomes a single shot shotgun with horrible reload time and not much kick to it. The carbine rifle (by far my favorite weapon in the game) becomes a burst rifle, I fail to see the point in having to spent 3 rounds with each shot and when you consider the recoil of the weapon it becomes almost useless. If not for the achivements I would have gone through the game using only the carbine and the sniper, which are weapons that are available pretty from much the onset of the game. Thus the feeling of progression is completely missing, this has to be IMHO a videogame first.  - Vigors ... now I realise the gun play might not be the emphasis of this game. Since the Vigors appear to be the focus of gameplay and the developers certainly wanna keep you using them. A point which is very evident, since the game will remind you to use these with an onscreen message. If you haven't used them in a while. The problem with Vigors though, are that they are more or less plasmids (bioshock) and I feel like they are mostly the same as they were in the original bioshock. But in that game it was new and exciting gameplay feature, this time around it just feel like recycling.  - Gear is special wearable items to grant gameplay perks, which sounds great in theory. But the execution is unforgiveable. Gear is managed from a menu 1/6 the size of the screen, the rest of the screen is just black. In this day and age of 1080p, why is it that this particular menu is presented in 540p. Furthermore the system is so underutilized that it's ridiculous. It's a klonky designed and cumbersome to use, it seems like an afterthought. The game made me aware of the menu with a small onscreen message which is so anonymous that I failed to notice it the time I played the game. And it wasn't until halfway through the game that I decided to go online to figure out how to manage my gear. Now there is technically nothing wrong with me missing an onscreen message, but this game goes out of it ways with tutorial messages. You will get the most basic of tutorial messages again and again (every time you come back into the game it's like it has forgotten it has already shown you these hints). Which makes the single notice of the gameplay menu that much more revealing.  - The game has you use Elisabeth as a locksmith. But even this leads to confusion. It took me one and half play through before I realized that locked doors came in two varities. Those that need lockpicks and those that don't. The ladder being locked doors you need to open to progress in the game and the former small treasure rooms with loot (if you can call it loot in this game). This made my relationship with lockpicks and the use of these rival Scrooge McDuck and his relationship with money. Mainly because I was afraid that I wouldn't have a lockpick when need to progress in the game and thus get stuck. This was never explained properly, again it seems at odds with a game that keeps displaying tutorial messages.  - The game suffer from some poor level design. The game features different areas. Switching between these leads to a loading screen, not that there is anything wrong with that. But the level design is sometimes really questionable. In one instance you leave an area (of medium size) to enter a house which is TINY (a two story building). Only to find that you only need to talk to one person and then you return to the medium sized area. Why there is a loading screen in between those two areas are beyond me, the engine seems pretty capable of having this house been in the same space without a loadingscreen - And to makes things worse, the game have you return to this tiny location several times.   Conclusion  I haven't touched upon the story, because I don't want to risk spoilers. But the story is very complex and interresting. Between the story and the character Elisabeth this game is no doubt a classic and you shouldn't rob yourself the pleasure of experiencing it.  That said between the guns and vigors issues. The game stopped being fun and often felt like a downright chore just to progress the story. Largely in part because the game often has you going back and fourth over the same piece of real estate. I'd give the game a 7/10, but since Elisabeth is such an interresting companion/character, I'll give the game an extra point for her alone.  8/10",1,0

There are a few things to look out for: it's totally possible to build your character in a way that will make it difficult, if not impossible to finish the game. Each character needs to focus on their strengths and ignore superfluous stats/abilities.

4694662,360390,Nightside,"This game feels like the good old Stuff from Westwood Studios back in the 90tes. This game looks really nice. And its an awesome Idea with a dark planet where you need the light to see something.   Meanwhile it work online and does have a solid multiplayer. By the way all 4 factions do have different gameplay.  Its the first RTS where you do have a real mobile base and Transformers. The human faction can move buildings everywhere and the YX are Transformers, you buy as YX mobile units, you can combine them to make a battle unit or a building out of them. if you want something else just let them separate and combine to something else.  The new Faction Noxx do have really interesting game play with mobile base too.  And each unit can be upgraded in stronger ones.    This game does have a really good AI, the human faction AI can be a challenge.   Its just feels like a true RTS again, with have Base build , research and lot of different units with some unique ideas.",1,1

I had to through trial and error spend more than an hour to figure out how to fix it, but ended up re-downloading the game entirely.  After that was solved, i booted up the game to some lag, which was quickly removed by disabling MSAA (AM using Nvidia) in the graphics options. The game runs kinda smooth, with occasional stutters and lag.  From there, everything went straight to ♥♥♥♥, even worse than before.  I can't even play the game. I can't load games, and i can't save games. I can't exit/enter metros as the game crashes. The tech supoort is non-existent, even though i have made multiple threads stating my issues.

The fighting feels fluid and fast-paced, there are cool characters, quality waifus, and boobs. It's a proven formula. I've played Last Round on the PS4 extensively, and I really like it; definitely recommended. I recommend this game for fans of the series, or the genre, who do not own one of the next (current) gen consoles. If you have a console, get that version.  The PC version lacks the ease of access that picking up a controller and sitting down on a couch grants, it lacks certain advanced physics ;D technology, and the console versions have higher quality effects. It's 95% of the package, and that's enough, but it's not quite the whole thing.  There are mods, not as many, or as good as you might hope, but they are out there.",1,0
3700448,294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"I bought this because it was discribed as an RPG.  It isn't.  The story is progressed by a load of cutscenes interspaced with a fairly simplistic turn-based battles. Outside of the battles you have no control over your charicter. The game has its fun moments but its about as much of an RPG as playing a game of chess after watching an episode of your favorate show.  The art is nice but quite basic in the battles. The game mechanics are like a poor mans X-com, fun but with most of X-coms choices taken away.  I really don't think this deserves Steams 96% rating, even the story is remarkably basic (some people without any experiance with JRPG's or Anime may find it a bit hard to follow but not due to complexity.)  I feel more than a little cheated tbh, imagine buying cheese from the supermarket and find out its Yogurt when you get it home, Technicaly its close, both are processed cow's milk. The same with this game, its not an RPG its a turn based combat game with lots of cutscenes.  &lt;edit&gt; having now finished the game I can stand by the original review. The difficulty curve also seems a little off (mission 7 was a massive ramp up, later missions a cakewalk.).   The Ranking system that rewards you with a grade at the end of a mission and calculates the rewards is only based on how many rounds, not tactics or losses so listening to the briefing at the beginning of a battle can trick you into a lower rank.  The game is fun most of the time. It is worthy of a cheap purchase. Don't expect a JRPG experiance.",-1,0

3419382,281990,Stellaris,"This is my first review, and I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in as the reviews seem to be mixed on both main forums of paradox and here.   The game its self is O.K. I can't praise it as I would like, but then again I can't really be too negative about it. The game, as all games these days when released, have to have a bit of work done to them to smooth the bumps etc and Stellaris is no different.  The potential seems very high, and I no doubt that it will reach it over time. But, for now, the game for me is seriously lacking in content - especially mid game and it becomes more of a chore than an enjoyment. There are also quite a few bugs, but paradox aren't wasting too much time getting around to them and their next major patch seems to tackle alot of the issues that exist as well as improving the content and meta of the game.  It's definitely one of those that you have to take a chance on and I will be eagerly waiting in anticipation for how the game turns out and the journeys it will take me on trying to explore all it's possibilities.

3343105,274560,Revolution Ace,"I rate the game Revolution Ace 4/5.  This game is extremely similar to the old Apogee game, Raptor: Call of the Shadows but is not implemented quite as well in some ways but it is much less expensive. The music and sound is mediocre and the graphics look pretty drab. The plot is insipid and uninventive. Cooperative (and uncooperative) multiplayer modes with another computer can be set up through steam but the process is unintuitive and a little bit tricky. Once you get it working however, the multiplayer modes work very reliably. The game's pace (and perceived rate of motion) is quite slow for the type of arcade-style action shooter game that it is. However, everything else about this game is very well done. The game has 4 difficulty levels and offers a more challenging version of itself to play after you beat the main campaign. Individual levels can be replayed easily. Playing any mode allows you to earn more monies for upgrading your airplane too and the upgrade and leveling system is well designed. The game also has a random mode which can give you a random fight above any terrain type you want. For just 5 dollars (without it even being on a special steam sale) this game is quite extensive and replayable.",1,0

If you get hit by an enemy while it's advancing and try to hit it afterwards, doesn't work. Jump back and THEN punch. I wanted to go fast, but the game forced me to go slowly and precisely.  Some mini boss attacks are impossible to read unless you've played before, for example, the mini boss in... Pumpkin something? Can't remember. Anyway, that mini boss has an attack that goes in a straight line across the screen in an instant and you have no way of knowing if it will do that attack until it has attacked.  You WILL get hit and you WILL get salty. You either play it till the end or not.     On that note, I can still recommend it since it's still, what, version 1.1?. It's on the hard side until you learn how to play it well, which I didn't.  There are a lot of positive things to say about this game, but I'm not a very positive person and always choose to focus on the negative instead of talking about the good things in life.

1587461,223810,Ys I,"YS I &amp; II Chronicles are oldschool, revamped games updated from the original games made about 20 years or so ago. I never played the originals but I remember reading about them in gaming magazines and had some brief experience with one of them on the Super Nintendo so long ago. Ever since then I've always beeen curious to see what the Ys games are about.  The game is fast paced with a very simple interface. The entire combat system is bump based. Just run into badies and they die. The challenge is that you cannot hit them directly on center or you will take damage. It takes quite a bit of getting used to and you can quickly impale yourself on your enemies sword on Nightmare difficulty. The music is just as energetic as the gameplay and keeps you moving along. The xp system like all xp systems allows you to grind but you'll find no need to do so. The character seems to level fast enough without the need to spend extra time smashing bad guys for no reason. Which you'll probably do anyway because why not tackle everything in sight?!  The story is fairly short and seems oddly familiar like most games of its era. For some this may be disapointing. I honestly enjoyed playing through the game with it's clear story that stays on track. So many JRPGs of late take steps way out into the realm of crazy and confusing. This game keeps it simple. By the end I was satisfied but don't expect to spend countless hours in this game because it has no side quests or objectives at all.  Final Verdict: Neutral  Buy this game if you're a fan of Ys and like short games. Avoid if you've got better things to do.",1,0

Think 'Black Adder Goes Forth' except every episode is the series finale from a different perspective.Hell, the comic book style graphics ADD to the grim feeling when a character gets a GAME OVER.Oh and theres a rhythm-based driving stage where our heroes are being gunned down by Germans whilst classical music plays.Germans.Shooting at you.

458334,200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Pros: Very polished, great graphics (both tactical and immersive), addictive, high replay value... top example of the genre. Cons: Limited RPG element, weak main storyline. Requires the 'Within' DLC to add depth in both these departments. Recommendation: Yes, buy it. And on sale @75% off or more, a no-brainer.  As more of an FPS/RTS player, I was open but skeptical when i bought XCOM, even on sale. Having now put a damnable number of hours into it, I can safely say that XCOM strikes me as one of those shining examples that are included in anyone's top picks of a genre.  While the turn-based tactical squad combat is the substance, it's woven around managing your base expansion, economy, research agenda, soldier roster (RPG element), and squadron of planes/ships, not to mention maintaining the happiness of individual countries on a global level via satellite placement and interventions. Because there are so many ways to come at your overall approach, and because you get a new roster of soldiers to customize each time, the replay value is immense.  One note on that. As (also) an RPG player, I found myself getting invested in individual soldiers, since you can customize appearance and voice, not to mention skills and equipment (I still get wistful thinking about how badass my squad was, e.g. Ukrainian sniper Natalya 'Vodka' Stolichnaya). Much of the addictive and replay appeal is in evolving these characters, although many RPG fans may find these options painfully constrained.  And that brings me to one of my only critiques, something that was a thorn in my side even as I greatly enjoyed the game - limited customization and depth, which detracts from an already weak storyline (one grating example was that while you get a range of voices to choose from, they are all distinctively American English, which really clashed with the idea of an international team). The expansion 'Within' actually goes a long way to address this, by adding depth across the board (deeper story, more soldier skills and customization, even several languages) and while definitely worth getting for that and a host of other reasons, it's not a part of this game or review.  Overall, a solid game, worth getting.",1,0

4693752,360170,How to Survive 2,"I liked the first How To Survive so much, I played a lot the torrent version, now I bought an original copy just because of supporting devs.  I think this second game is a lazy attempt to gain some money from stupid people (like me) who bought this crap blindly, just because they liked the first one.    First of all the graphics is the same, almost 10 year old.    The sound effects are the same stupid ♥♥♥♥ as the first one. Its unbelievable that an infected rabbit sounds like a broken car engine.    No background music, except for 'horde music'.   The crafting system is messy and difficult, the character leveling progression is silly and lazy.   Is no more possible to aim with the right stick when a melee weapon is equipped, it's unbelievable! This cause a lot of problems during melee fights, its like shoo away flies blindly.   The  sleep needs  misteriously disappeared in this second game, just like  safe houses  and  water sources , I can't understand why.  The only nice thing is the campsite, cold comfort.  I reached the level 12 and I was already bored at level 5. All missions are boring and repetitive. The urban environments are repetitive and glitchy. The enemies are the same as the first HTS except for a little add.  Finally I can't recommend this game to anyone. I hope developers will make a huge patch that fix everything.

2152594,238930,"7 Grand Steps, Step 1: What Ancients Begat","NOTE: The recommendation is  tentative , since it is a very limited game but does have its merits provided one likes the token-mechanic or the overall aesthetics, and  only applies to the game being on sale .  PRO:    very appealing artstyle and layout    unique mechanics and presentation    fitting musical score and ambient sound effects  CON:    limited gameplay options, making for a repetitive experience and hurting replayability    limited customisation and roleplay options    limited transparency regarding interactions of other characters [children, other families], making it difficult to plan ahead    repetitious random events, even at my fairly low playing time    too expensive for what it provides   A very unique game, especially in its presentation. You play by moving figurines along a rotating board, forced to keep moving clockwise before you get eaten by the crocodiles behind you, but the figurines can only be moved with the usage of tokens, indicating by their marking what field to move onto. Since you are playing through an entire period, you need to get a husband/wife and have up to seven children, who are not playable themselves [but can be selected as such once the current generation dies through crocodiles or old age] but can be levelled up - allowing them to produce more tokens. The children you don't chose as heirs can be used as restart points when your current line dies, providing for a very creative and well-integrated sort of checkpoint system. The 'progression' of the game is achieved by setting one of three goals that equate to collecting a certain amount of beads, strewn about on the board. Depending on what your goal is, you can benefit from various effects once they are achieved, such as changing the board to your favour by invalidating tokens of a now outdated kind. There is urgency here, too, since other families are progressing alongside you [though as far as I could see there is no way of telling where they stand or even how many there are] and can snatch awards away from you, making the game suddenly a lot harder.  There is a degree of deliberation in the token use and all strategy and engagement comes from this, but there are quite a lot of factors that are not in your control. The movement of the characters takes a while to get used to and invite a few lost turns near the beginning. But most egregious are the random events that are designed to shape your individual story. I wish I could say I liked them, since I'm generally very partial to flourishes of this kind, but I don't think they are handled very well. They can be beneficial or detrimental [to the point of killing you], are not necessarily linked to previous decisions and tend to repeat often, despite the circumstances being quite specific. In some cases, however, they fit nicely to the development path you've chosen, showing off a great side of the game and making it feel like an actual sensation of individual progression through history. Which is immediately lost when a bit later the exact same event occurs again. Also, after every generation you can chose an attribute to accompany your character [things like 'the generous'], but from what I've seen so far this has little impact on the game's random events, which is a huge shame.  There are consequences to your actions too, aside from running out of tokens or dying to the crocodiles, particularly in how you level your children. If you have many, you probably can't afford to treat them all the same, making them hostile to each other. There seems to be a high degree of randomness here too, since I've seen siblings get along fine despite being treated differently, and siblings hating each other even though I simply gave them different types of tokens. One of these sibling feuds was so bad that when I took over one child for the next generation, her sister - who hated her - barged into the game through random events CONSTANTLY [approx every six turns] and always made me loose a substantial amount of tokens. There was nothing I could do to prevent this, no way to change the relationship [since the sister was no longer on the board] and since I didn't understand the hatred in the first place it felt like a cheap way to make the game more challenging or 'dramatic'. And that is the biggest gripe of the game in my opinion; You have very little impact. A lot of things are out of your control, you can only try and stay on top of things. I'm sure this was intended to some extent [the families are, in a sense, expendable after all], but for a game that also tries to focus on a story development aspect it is very underwhelming. Though it may seem otherwise,  you are not playing as characters, you are managing tokens . The lack of RP elements which I was, perhaps falsly, expecting makes the game quite one-sided to me and doesn't help its replayability. I'm sure mastery of the game's tactical side can be intriguing to some, but to me the tactical aspect seems underdeveloped and too much outside of your control [a staple of many board games, tbh].  The game revolves around one single game mechanic and a gimmicky but not unappealing presentation. You need to try and stay ahead of the game, hoping that random events or decisions aren't too much to your detriment, and trudge along collecting as many beads as possible. If the mechanics sound appealing or the graphics enjoyable, it may well be worth the investment provided it is on sale [the asking price is way to high]. But if neither of those seem worthwhile, stay far away from this game.  I myself have had a decent time with it and I might even come back to it at a later date. But for now, the monotony of the experience and the limited strategic impact combined with the hardly at all present customisation of characters were enough to prevent me from revisiting it quite yet.",1,0

1544496,223710,Cry of Fear,"[Potential Spoilers!] Cry of Fear is a psycological horror-shooter in an area similar to Stockholm, Sweden. You play as Simon, just some ordinary guy suffering from severe depression and what I think, due to the monsters, some schizophrenia. The game starts off with a segment of a man crawling towards Simon, uging for help, but Simon does not respond in kind and harms the man, bashing his head into a wall. Then there's a few fades to a blood-soaked padded cell, but the blood seems to spell something. Then the game cuts back to Simon, who stands around for a second before getting hit by an off-roading vehicle. Then there is some gameplay where you take pictures of the letter X that reveal a sinister plot and then a face screaming at you in the end. Waking up in an alleyway with no recollection of what exactly happened before-hand armed with a (Slightly blood-stained) knife and a cell phone. Checking on his phone, he gets a text from his mother, urging him to come home, however; Simon cannot respond, as he has no service. (We all know that feeling, eh?) Then you embark on an adventure through the town on finding a way to get back home.  This is the introduction to Cry of Fear, originally a Half-life mod and later a full Steam release, which I will be reviewing because I have no clue what the difference is but if there is one, you're getting the Steam release. This game is made by the same dev team who made Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut. Winning quite a number of Indie Game awards, and rightfully so. But, just a fair warning, this game is grim and can cause nightmares. Some things could turn one off about this game, such as dated graphics and a slightly odd control scheme.  Pros +Story Rich +Great voice acting +Amazing add-on maps +Spooks all around! +Guns don't feel too over-powered and feel as though they're tools for survival +Puzzles that aren't too difficult but aren't too easy Cons -MP is difficult to operate without Hamachi -difficult platforming sections -monsters are a bit difficult if that's a con to you.

Catastrophic failure! Dying! More dying! Well damn it... LET'S TRY AGAIN! :D   For those reading this review FTL is a great game. If you are a fan of real time strategy and space exploration, this is for you. It will make you happy. It will make you cry. Then it will make you lust for the eventual success of your ship and then destroy your hopes with a lucky laser blast from the enemy.    You will love your crew. You may even make little stories for them and give them cool names. Then as each of them get slaughtered by the shear evil and danger of space you will cry silent tears as you attempt to hold up your ship with the single surviving crew member you have left. But do not keep faith, as he or she too will go down with the ship. You will say that you will never forget the brave men and women who fought valiantly to save the Federation and then immediately toss them aside when you create a new game with a brand new ship to do the same insanely difficult task.    Sometimes you will get sidetracked by the small quests and hard decisions you will have to make, sacrificing essential resources that could have won you the game in the end. The Rebels may catch up to you and blow you into little chunks, dying in vain and no doubt increasing the effect of Kessler’s Syndrome over the planet you had orbited. But never fear, for the universe is too big to give any lick of care for your loss. But in the end you will still go back to the hanger to unlock new ships and toys to better assist you in your quest to beat the Rebel scum.    If you mod this game you will have even more fun, inevitably dying but getting cooler weapons, effects, and in the case of the 'Captain's Edition' mod, a ton of more unique encounters and background stories that may or may not assist in the explosion of your ship.    In conclusion this is a great game. It may be 2D and pixilated but FTL definitely feeds adventure, strategy, and excitement to its players who will end up dying over and over to just to save the fleeting Federation. ",1,0

3175953,26800,Braid,"Braid is a modern day visual masterpiece. Crafted by true artist, and refined to perfection. It brings together several very original gameplay concepts, a subtle and mysterious storyline, that all just mesh into one special experience. Put in its most simple terms, Braid is a unique puzzle game.  Have I hyped the game up enough? Nay I say unto you. Nay! Braid is classic. It could have come out 15 years ago and would still be just as good.  Braid is a side scrollin’ action platformer. You’ll start each level at the far left side, and you’re objective is to reach the far right side. Its pretty much Mario Bros game in that sense. You can’t punch, attack, or shoot anything. You’re only offensive weapon is your ability to inexplicably kill foes when making contact with the top of their heads with your feet.   What sets Braid’s gameplay apart and makes it so darn special, is its manipulation of time and space. At any point in the game, you can turn back time. You just simply press the “X” button and you can go all the way back to the beginning of the level. Even when your character dies, you can still turn back time and come back to life. But don’t think for a second that you’re adventure is going to be a breeze just because you can turn back time. Oh boy do things get dicey!  Each level is a labyrinth filled with key, locked doors, foes, flame pits, seemingly insurmountable gaps and walls. Its a madhouse. If I were to tell you half of the things I experienced in Braid, you’d all think I was a madman. There are some things you just have to experience for yourself.  As you progress through the storyline, you’ll unlock new abilities. You’ll need to use these abilities in conjunction with other abilities to pass most levels. And its not super easy to know which ability to use. For example, in Zelda you’ll have a certain color block that you can use a hammer on. Or a block that you can hookshot to. Braid is not at all like that, its more like building a house. The game supplies you with the required tools and the lumber, but you need to make your own blueprints and build it yourself. It feels like a big sandbox playground of wonder and delight.  Braid looks spectacular. Downloadable game or not, Braid is a work of art. To me, each level resembles a a fluid watercolor painting. There is so much originality and detail. Its almost otherworldly.  The sound track and music is all original and composed. I have actually downloaded several of the tracks and I listen to them sometimes when I’ve surfing the net. Also, one thing the game does, is whenever you turn back time, the musical track will also play backward.  Each level contains a couple of hidden or hard to reach puzzle pieces. You’ll need to collect all of these puzzle pieces in order to reach the final level. You will really need to stretch your mind sometimes to figure out exactly how to get some of the pieces in the latter level. But it can be extremely rewarding once you do figure it out. One thing I will strongly suggest against; DO NOT USE GAMEFAQS! Its ok to use Gamefaqs for some games, but don’t use it for this one. There is no reward in cheating in a puzzle game. Just use your mind, or get a friends opinion on what to do. You’ll thank me when all is said and done.  Since its original release on the Xbox 360, Braid has been ported to the PC and the Playstation 3. All three versions are spectacular.  I haven’t liked a puzzle game as much as Braid since I played Shadow of the Colossus about 5 years ago. They both provide a sense of ambiguous anxiety that I love when approaching a puzzle. Braid a masterpiece of art, a series of modern day puzzle/riddles, and just basically an overall fun game. Easiest 5/5 all year.  Written April 2010 for website allgamesplayed given a 5 out of 5",1,0

5379267,414130,Fall of the Titanic,"It was a tough choice whether I should recommend this game or not! Firstly, Fall of the Titanic should be under Steam's eary access. Secondly, the game is bulit on the unity engine......The textures are...well...unity like. Gameplay is meh, not good nor bad. Needs a overhaul in terms of graphics, and gameplay needs to flow beter. Is there hope? Yes! Maybe not invest your money now but later down the road. Many improvements have to be made to the game but so far it's okay for $3.00. It's better than The Slaughtering Grounds, thats forsure!  Things I would like to see that are not listed above: -Coop mode -Steam Workshop -NPC's (I think the devs are going to add that soon) -Voice overs for the game -Make equipment and keys easier to find! -More hints during the game.

1931067,233250,Planetary Annihilation,"This game has come a long way since the kickstarter and the Beta.  I'd like to start off by conceding the point that the game in it's most current state is far from being finished. The games still missing features, units and buildings mentioned prior. Why the sudden release? I can't say for sure. There was probably a good reason for it and the game in it's most current form is pretty solid.   But with this in mind I honestly think that any sort of proper review is problematic in the extreme because continued updates and support for the game will likely make any sort of review outdated. But with this in mind I'll share my most initial thoughts and hope that this helps somebody.   First and foremost is the gameplay. This is something that will likely change the most in the coming weeks and months as Uber continues fiddling around with everything and ultimately I'd like to say that its a pretty solid and fun foundation to the game. Most of the current units are satisfying in the extreme and everything is useful to some degree or another and can factor into any sort of strategy you might concieve of.  The Orbital mechanics of the game are also intriguing and I expect that as time marches on it'll become a cornerstone to the game.   Many people complain about the small size of the planets compared to the relative size of the units. The only thing I can say to those people are, 'What did you expect?' this aspect to the game has been apart of the game since it's kickstarter. I'm really more then a little surprised that people act shocked and surprised about this. The game is obviously less about 'realism' and more about style and for the game it works.   Ultimately though? The gameplay is fun, not perfect, certainly not complete. But fun and somewhat stable. The game will continue to improve as time goes on but for right now it's pretty engaging and more importantly entertaining.    Graphics wise the game is pretty good. It's not groundbreaking stuff obviously, they were working on a modest budget. But also the developers went with a radically simplified aesthetic to prevent the game from slowing down to a crawl during the game and the art style, bright colorful and a little cartoony plays offsets it's graphical simplicity and makes it somewhat unique and interesting.     Is the game worth purchasing? If the Dev's are going to continue tweaking and adjusting the gameplay and adding more features and units post-launch, then most defintely.   ",1,0

1919670,233150,LUFTRAUSERS,"(7.5/10)  The arcade action is just about what you could have hoped for, along with some decent strategy and personal skill progress via the various different upgrade combinations.  The aesthetic is also incredibly cool and sort of that modernist retro that has been the rage lately. Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.  Its not necessarily spilling over with replayability. The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion. Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.  The one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*. While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there. While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me. I ended up setting the gamepad down and just using the keyboard because in the end it was easier to manage.",1,0

909454,211820,Starbound,"Let me say, I love this game.   I don't love the developers.   They promised two years ago not to wipe characters ever again. This isn't an MMORPG, so it's a reasonable expectation that they'd keep this promise.   1.0 Release day, Characters wiped. Those 5 years of development they spent, 2 of them characters were safe. The game is still great, but if they don't keep their word on patch wipes, how do we know it wont' happen again?  Just wanted to add, I tried it again. I will say the new content and seeing the actual monster hit Earth was a nice plus, but the very well-written tutorial of fixing your engines is no-where to be seen. Now, it's just 'hey, find a power source' and you're stuck on a planet. All crafting is much more expensive, Dyes have been forced into usefulness (you can't make some crafting surfaces without them), and there's a new crafting table that you have to craft and use to craft all other crafting tables.   The ramp up in difficulty is rather nuts, especially considering a new survival mechanic where you have to eat to heal or live is in play. Missions have been added, but no level scaling is there at all, so a mission issued by a villager on the first world got me killed repeatedly because pancakes. Your character is much less intelligent in that things you'd learn are much slower.   Campiness has been ramped up and slaughters any sense of immersion you could have with these largely leave-it-to-your-imagination graphics. Halfway toward the core, which I was digging toward out of habit more than any degree of purpose, I found gnome cities. That's right. Gnomes. Little tiny hospitals and houses and windmills. In Terraria this would make sense, but in Starbound, it's just stupid. What's worse is that they serve as an early ranged weapon.   Yes, you read that right. An early ranged weapon.   It's called 'Ball of Gnomes' and does a pretty hefty amount of damage against weak targets. Apparently, your character is comfortable with balling up a sentient species in his hand, smashing their houses as he goes, and throw the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in a shotgun blast at your target. That's good, because it's going to be a long, long time before you find that un-mapped location that has a supposed energy source to leave the planet.   This is effectively a completely different game from the version we've seen evolve for 5 years, and not in a good way. For a long time this release was anticipated, but it's honestly a disappointment with no way to go back to where we came from. I was going to get another copy of this for my son, but now he'd just make fun of the gift for how silly it becomes, and then quit because of the unbelievable difficulty spikes. This plays like an overthought, overfeatured sequel to a game that I came to know and love for years before. Unfortunately, it also completely destroys your saves and removes your copy of that original game, and replaces it with something that doesn't even come close to resembling the difference between an open beta and a final release.   5/10 because NMS isn't out yet to do it better.",-1,1

This game is pretty fun with friends, and plays EXACTLY like Diablo but more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if that makes sense. Anwyay, this: Cons-  -Diablo clone -no character cuztomization, whatspever -characters start with clothes that dont change as you go through the game -you have to play for too long to get armour that actually covers your whole body/clothes you started with. ex: templar doesnt ever get any pants cuz he doesn't start with any, its 'boots' instead and the Barbarian ( I think that's what its called, never has anything covering his arms until like lvl 16-ish(wich take a few hours). -Map is a bit confusing and the camera orientation changes randomly and really screws with my sense of direction. (But the change is subtle so i don't notice until I'm actually lost and realize im going tp much to the right instead of left to get to the next area for a quest) -THE TEMPLAR HAS NO PANTS YET HE'S AN OLD MAN. Also im pretty sure a templar isnt a mage but they make em out to be *shrug* -begining armours make your character look like an IDIOT.the iron helmet just looks like a bucket or something , its like my characters are wearing scraps or something (wich is sorta immersive considering the situation so thats cool though  Pros- -Graphics arnt actually too bad, considering its free. (might be able to run on potato if you have one idk though it's not like ive tested that) -Only thing you pay for is cosmetics and pets. (wich i dont care for personally) -Story is actually decent if you listen to it, like Iv'e done. -the way sloting in skills into weapons is sorta cool (except for when I have a good item that doenst have the slots that i need for a skill i like so i end up giving up skills for others until I get armour thats better with the slots i need) -skill tree is HUGE and confusing but gets pretty neat at lvl 11+ but sorta sucks when i need dexterity for a weapon and cant use and and I'm forced to use something lesser (mostly sucks for barbarian and templar) -This game is suprisingly casual, wich can be nice for certain people (like me) -Fun to play with friends, (unless theyve played Diablo and know how vastly superior it is)  This concludes my review, hope it helped. This game is free though so you might as well get it anyway if you wanna see what Diablo is sorta like(simply keep in mind Diablo is better).",1,0

5317993,406550,Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"(I've completed this game using the Witch Hunt translation, so everything I say will be coming from that)  Umineko is a visual novel released between 2007 and late 2010 (with these episodes, the Question Arcs, being released in 2007 and 2008). It is a murder mystey/fantasy novel packed with tons of content to keep you on your toes at all times... for the most part.  The story itself is probably one of the best things I've ever read, including all visual novels, regular novels, fiction/non-fiction, etc.. In short, it involves a family going to an island that is only inhabited by the family head and a some other family members. They go there, and they recieve a letter from a mysterious entity calling themselves 'Beatrice', saying they must find the gold hidden on the island, or she will be forced to recieve 'interest' from them. From then on, strange things happen, and people start questioning their trust for each other, yada yada other murder mystery things.  While the story is amazing, it DOES drag for a bit for the first 4-6 hours, basically the entire first in game day in the first episode. After that though, the story hooks you in and refuses to let go until you've ended up binging the entire episode, and it only leaves you craving more.  One thing I especially love about Umineko is how, even though it has LOTS of them (There are at least 18[!] of them introduced just in the first day of the first episode alone, and there are MANY more introduced later), it uses all its characters efficiently. You're never left feeling some characters are under utilized or under developed. Even though some characters definitely get more development than others (but really, in a cast of so many characters, can you blame them?), even the most under developed character still feels complete.  All in all, Umineko is probably one of the most visual novels, let alone novels, in the past decade. I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.  9.5/10",1,0

2210591,239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,"The Chinese Room has an excellent writer (or writers), of this I have no doubt. A Machine for Pigs burrows its way into Victorian fear of its own industrious brave new world, the hallmarks of futurism, and existential musings on the nature of man and evil. All of this wrapped in grimy, visceral prose, much akin to the machinery the player stalks the bowels of.  But it feels TCR overstepped their creative boundaries into what drew people in Frictional's previous titles Penumbra and The Dark Descent completely. Gone are the inventories, the limited resources, the ever-growing insanity. Your light never fails, you never need to drag an object more than twenty feet, and death is only a temporary setback. It feels almost as if Frictional had very little to do with it, aside from the Amnesia brand name and some input on nasty monstrosities out to eat the player (And these moments are very few). You will spend a lot of time walking around and listening to talking. Doesn't that seem familiar, now? Dear Esther was an experiment, one I feel failed, but dragged kicking and screaming into this long awaited project. I think Frictional were tossed to the side as nothing more than code monkeys, with the rest of the design process dominated by The Chinese Room. Do not seek a survival horror, here: Whatever plans for it have been buried by script dictation.  It's not all bad, though. If you do want the thick atmosphere of rusted, Victorian machinery, the trudging through the catabolism of our species as the anabolism of it stalks you, and finding out just what those colourful piggie masks are all about, I suppose you could do a little worse than spending the tenner to find out just what exactly lies deep beneath that meat packing plant. But if TCR want to create Dear Esther, then try to inject that piece of ♥♥♥♥ into Amnesia, then I'm going to hold it to the same criticisms: What is it, in the medium of videogames, that I could not have experienced or entertained from a good book, or an elaborate theme park ghost house? If you want to challenge the medium of videogames, you're going to have to do better than this.

2957937,257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"  Possibly one of the most incredible indie games I've played. Everything about it I feel was carried out in a very particular fashion that I just couldn't help but enjoy. Mixing Legend of Zelda with Metroid in such a way keeps the game challenging but not impossible, while keeping you in awe with some of the dark but beautiful imagery that the game has to offer. The color scheme is fantastic, the gameplay is awesome, the content is surprisingly vast, and the lore has more to it than you'd expect. There may be some issues every now and then with the low frame rate cap, which doesn't mesh well with the fast-paced gameplay of Hyper Light Drifter. Once in a while you may find yourself bewildered as to how you just died, and truthfully an ideal game would ensure that every death is fair. However, I'm willing to let this one issue slide just because this game hit all of the right points for me, and at the end of the day I didn't run into the problem so often that it changed the game for me. Additionally, the devs are still actively listening to suggestions and updating the game. About a month ago co-op was added because so many people wanted it. You can definitely get your money's worth out of this. Also do not, I repeat, DO NOT play using keyboard/mouse. USE A CONTROLLER. The game is meant to be played with a controller. Ignore any of the downvotes just because they played with a keyboard/mouse setup and had a tough time. Trust me, all in all fantastic game, which coming from me means a lot since I don't usually bother with reviews, but this game just got me so good and I love it.

Its telling me to login through Steam when I am logged into Steam and it won't register my account as logged in. Super lame. To be honest though without those free DLC codes for the Winters Grasp and Team Justice I might not have even bothered spending so much time playing Forge of Gods. I might recommend if it was still playable, but even then its iffy. Sure it is addicitive, but is it enough?   The food (energy) timer is not that good as most events/ battles took up 10-20 meat and my max meat was only about 95ish even at rank 18. At this point just about everything cost me 20 meat and I'd be stuck waiting on timers.   The paywalls are everywhere and inbetween. I managed to do just fine without ever bothering with the premium subscrition upgrade though. Paywalls for army space, for getting better creatures, for affording upgrades/ evolutions, ect.  I liked the character/ creature design and evolving the most. PvP was alright.  There is a story, but the timers mixed with incorrect estimations on strength required, well it'll take a while to progress into the story. That and with having to spend all of your energy on dailies for gold, shadows (fuse for extra exp), and evolve materials.  Edit: Finally decided to check again and the game is working for me now.

1783774,230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I very much believe that Divinity: Original Sin is only for a certain kind of player. Namely, one that doesn't get frustrated easily. It's a classic Fallout/Shadowrun turned based Tactics game, and I've quit playing it out of frustration (alt tab/close window) more times than any other game in recent memory. It's littered with so many minor problems (many of which other games have found solutions for) that eventually you'll throw your arms up and promise yourself that THIS TIME, you're going to quit playing it for good. But then 15 minutes later, grim and determined, you're back. You see? I'm just trying to save you from this whole spiral of self-loathing and despair. It's going to be spending 15 minutes organizing your inventory every time you find a bit of junk, or dying 10 times to a boss that's just one level ahead of you until you have to go back to an earlier save, or vainly trying to figure out what the actual next step of the questline is, or trying to glean the practical application out of the cryptic crafting books you find, or just the sheer amount you have to save to avoid redoing a lot of the crap that you've already done, yeah, one of these things will finally get to you. Not that it's a bad game entirely, that's the problem. It's complex and diverse, the character classes are interesting and there's an intricate world to explore. At times it reminds me of Dragon Age 2 - I've wandered through the opening town of Cyseal so many times I'm reciting the lines of the merchants/civilians/legionnaires before they even come on screen (the cheese merchant is my favorite, apparently in a time before celebrity movie stars he who had cheese was most popular). There's just so many things that take so much longer than they should. You have to micro-manage everything and you end up with so much junk that you just start throwing it away, all those tantalizing craftables that I've used only a handful of times in the game so far. Someone else with a negative review did a brilliant job explaining the crafting system (using the example of creating a scroll) so I won't go into that. Just thinking too much about this game is getting me tired. So I'll end with the most critical piece of advice I could give a new player: don't fight anything that's even just one level above you. Yes, if you save before the fights and get lucky enough on your 131st try you may end up winning, but trust me, the chance for a random bit of useful loot is just not worth it. Good luck finding enemies your level though. (When you get to Cyseal, find the city gate on the west side of town (that's not barred), and fight westwards to the lighthouse before trying the rest of the map. Otherwise, like me, you'll know all the cheese merchant's lines by heart.) Oh yeah, forgot to mention this earlier but don't expect to level up more than once a YEAR. LATER EDIT: Once you get out of the early Cyseal areas, the game actually isn't as bad in terms of mismatching you against enemies. Plus, you learn that enemies stronger than you are the game designer's way of saying 'do not come this way yet'. That being said, I imagine many new players still find Cyseal difficult enough that it becomes a serious impediment to continuing with the game. However, all is not praise - I absolutely hate the ♥♥♥♥♥ rock, scissors, paper games. You make a decision, but your other accomplice protests, and you have to play this stupid game against them. Even when the decisions are SO ♥♥♥♥♥ OBVIOUS. Enemies are worse - I missed a whole mini-quest to recover a missing head because of one rock scissor paper defeat. Now where I am in the game, I have to beat an enemy TWICE and can only mess up once per duel (their Charm is at 6! While mine's only 3 - I can't tell what determines the score too). Whoever came up with this system should be beaten with a rock, cut multiple times with a piece of paper and finally put out of their misery with a pair of scissors. OH YEAH - one last thing - always hold ALT after a fight to see the drops... I'm certain I missed a TON of stuff by not doing this earlier in the game. ALT will reveal anything you can pick up, including drops.",-1,0

5037954,387290,Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition," Top 10 Platformer of the Century   The introduction teaches you about the world  without  extensive voiceover, and makes you care about two characters in less than two minutes. It also introduces the game's major villain with a plausible explanation for the villain's actions. The first stages teach you all the basics of how to play by adding new elements one-by-one, ensuring you're never challenged beyond what you're capable of doing, but aren't bored with too-easy tasks.  The middle section of the story focuses on exploration and the changes happening in the world because of your character's actions, which gives the player time to enjoy being exposed to all of the wonderful level art and musical themes. These changes are told through the dramas of minor characters in the story, fleshing out the world for the player to appreciate. Mechanically, players are given more and more powers and puzzles that require combining them, requiring a demonstration of mastery of the game's basic concepts. Each level typically focuses on twisting or changing one of those basic concepts (gravity, ability to double-jump, etc.) which means you're kept on your toes and continue learning new techniques in a challenging environment.  The last section of the story focuses on the relationship between the villian, the villain's objective and motivations, and the consequences for the world and the characters in it. Levels become stricter, as players have had several hours with the game at this point and are skilled in most of the basic concepts and their combinations. Happily, challenge ramps up just as the motive drive of the story pushes a player to want to complete the game and see the narrative through to the end.  The ending and epilogue make sense, are emotionally charged, provide closure to the story, and will absolutely leave you saying 'Well... that was one of the best games I've ever played.'  The story is perfectly paced. The music perfectly supports the action of the world. The art direction is phenomenal throughout. Animation and creature design is top notch. The characters are believable, likable, relatable, and unique. The mechanics are ridiculously well designed. In short, measure all other platformers by standards gleaned from Ori's story, design, art direction, and philosophy.     Buy, play, and cherish this game.   Also, write a thank-you note to Moon Studios for spending their lives making this masterpiece.",1,0

4096625,317300,Roommates,"Pretty good, lighthearted VN. It has pretty cliche characters, but each one has a different side to them if you get to know them better. It's nothing mindblowing, you won't find a lot of earthshaking literature here but it's entertaining and stays entertaining.  There's two playable characters, one male and one female with four romance paths each for a total of eight paths. Two of those paths are same-sex paths. The stat system and picking your schedule is very gamey and doesn't do much except artificially close off the 'good' endings if you do it wrong. Basically you pick out a character you want to romance and only pick activities that are associated with the stats they apparently like. There's no consequences for never raising any of the other stats except the two you need. I guess you can care about grades too, but you can just study in the time blocks where your chosen stat activities aren't available. The so-called bad boy I played that wanted to drop out of college was a top student, while still getting the girl and finding time between the sexual tension to front a band.  It's a neat little story, but like I said it's not going to be an intellectual roller-coaster and it's not meant to be. Roommates is a VN about light comedy, light romance and sweet character interaction.

3414195,281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"I reluctantly requested a refund on this one today, even though I very much liked the overall graphics, the gameplay, and pretty much everything about it. Unfortunately, the one thing that I didn't like was the proverbial 'game killer' for me.  Here's the thing: You've got a good variety of units, all of them with very nice graphics, the combat effects are quite nice - great explosions and so on -- but you can't zoom out your view far enough to really see what's going on. To do that - to zoom out to a range where you can get a large enough picture to let you make solid tactical decisions, to see where the enemy are, and intelligently direct your forces to properly respond to the attacks -- you have to switch from the nice graphics that make this so nice to the eye into a high altitude radar-like view where all the units are little colored dots or hollow triangles moving around on a flat 2D map. Take a look at the FIVE video clips shown on the Steam store page. You can go through almost all of all five of them and what you see are almost exclusively shots of the good looking unit graphics, a few cut scenes, and more nice closeups of units showing how nice they look. BUT to see what you'll be looking at for at least 50% of the time, jump to the 21 second point of the fifth video and you'll see the dots and hollow triangles that are what you see every time you pan out to get a larger tactical of the full strategic view.  Yes, they make it easy to swich between close up and zoomed out - just touch the space bar - but they have to make it easy, 'cause you have to spend so much time in the zoomed out view, it has to be easy to access, right?  Why, oh WHY, make a game with such pretty graphics for their units, and their buildings, and then make you constantly switch to the view that robs the game of all those loveingly crafted components? *sighs heavily*  So - when someone posts a mod that lets you zoom waaay out and still see the decent graphics (they can even be tiny little units!) instead of dots and hollow triangles - someone email me and I'll re-purchase this one. I really, really wanted to like it (played both of the Homeworld games for years) but...honestly if I wanted to watch little dots moving around on the screen, I could get something made back in the 1980s.  Sorry, Devs - you made a very pretty game -- too bad you can't appreciate how nice the graphics are for over half the time you're playing.",-1,0

It's still probably best if you wait for it to go on sale but if you REALLY want to pick it up just be prepared for a competent but middling experience. Solid C+ territory. Not bad but not extraordinary either.  Long version:   Story - The setting is a unique breath of fresh air for the most part. Rather than attempting to save the world from the big bad, he's already won! And you're working for him. Rather than trying to be the big hero as in most RPG's you're just a high ranking flunky trying to make the best of a bad situation. If that's your thing of course. There are a number of paths you can choose with branching story options, enabling you to either be a decent person making tough decisions in a harsh world or a cackling maniac bathing in the blood of the innocent. It's up to you, really.   However, it starts to fall apart midway through the game as you gradually start receiving less choices based upon ones you made earlier. You'll find yourself railroaded into taking certain options, ones that make context given your decisions, yes, but railroaded all the same. The actual story itself isn't exactly engaging either. There are bits and pieces where you make some good, hard decisions but I found it to be lackluster overall. There was no Witcher 3 level of pathos, that's for sure. I wouldn't say it was bad. Decent at best. Passable at worst.  Characters - You don'tget a choice of a huge swath of companions here. There's a total of six and none of them really have the engaging personality of those from RPG's past. You won't find a charmingly funny Minsc or delightfully homicidal HK-47 in these parts. Again, they're not bad, per se, each possessing their own particular traits and quibbles that give you a firm sense of who they are but you likely won't become all that attached to them over the course of the game. There's also no personal quests for them either, no digging deeper into their backrounds or histories through an involved series of fun events. At most, you get a bunch of dialogue trees to click through. It's not exactly engaging. Occasionally they might make a snarky comment to one another while meandering along the map but nowhere near the extent of the back-and-forth banter you got in the likes of Dragon Age: Origins. So, here too, I'd say passable.  Combat - It's fine. Pretty fun, I'd say. It's essentially the same sort of system as Pillars of Eternity so if you liked combat in that game you'll like it in this one too. You have your standard choices of various weapons and magic all of which level as you use them so you can craft some interesting characters types without specifically selecting a single class. You can also craft your own magic spells which, as cool as it sounds, is not extraordinarily fun in practice. Speaking of crafting, you can also craft your own artifact items which have special abilities attached to them. They're often the best gear in the game and give you a feeling of accomplishment when you manage to lay your hands on them. So that's nice. Companions also learn special team moves they can combine with your character, like your character tossing the archer up into the air for an arrow storm. They're neat but often enough I just didn't bother using them. The animations just take too long for the effort and I found it more effective to just use my normal spells and sbilities.  As for difficulty, I played the game on normal and found it a tad too easy. The AI does a pretty decent job on its own deciding what spells to automatically cast or what moves to do without extensive intervention on my part. Micromanaging was needed at points but I found myself sitting back a fair bit and letting the AI do the work for me, only intervening here and there when it seemed a little tweak was needed in positioning or ability choice. It might be different on higher difficulty settings, of course, with more attention and focus needing to be paid to avoid dying, but after about halfway through the game it just became a fairly easy cakewalk.  UI - Awful. It's not unusable but it's most certainly a pain. You get a single 10 slot action bar with which to place spells, talents, reptuation abilities, artifact abilities, special team moves, and you discover that nope, there's no way you'll be putting everything useful on it. There are categorized buttons beneath it that'll open up a smaller interface containing all those moves so you'll often forget that you ever even HAD a ability to begin with since they're all kept out of sight. The character sheets also tell you rather little as to what many stats are for, necessitating a lengthy browse through the help menu to see exactly what precision does or how crit chance is calculated.   And since this is something of a quality of life thing, load times are also pretty bad. And you'll be seeing a LOT of the loading screen over the course of the game. Your main 'hub' area is essentially divided into five different zones, each of which you'll have to enter a loading screen to get to. Want to visit your trainers? Loading screen. Want to craft armor? Loading screen. Want to research scrolls? Loading screen. It gets pretty irritating after a while.   Graphics - Their really good. What can I say? It uses the same engine as Pillars of Eternity and looks just as great. Spell animations are flashy, characters move like they have weight, and it creates some pretty pretty pictures. If I had to nitpick, I'd say sone of the envornment design isn't exactly all that inspired. There wasn't all that much that popped out that made me go 'ooh' or 'ahh'.  Length - This is going to be a real stickler for most people. I played the game as in-depth as I could, doing every side mission I could find, spending time crafting, exploring, not simply rushing through the story, and I wound up clocking in at about 30 hours. Most RPG's nowadays tend to hit twice that. The game contains three acts and the third just flies by in the blink of an eye, so quick it might as well just have been shoved into the latter half of act two. The ending FEELS rushed and lacks a real sense of solid closure. It essentially just amounts to 'kill this guy, this guy, do a little talking, and done.' It also leaves the door wide open for DLC. It's just disappointing. With a story that's unique but somewhat lacking, having the game be this short just exacerbates the problem and makes Tyranny's faults all the more apparent.   There IS some replay value here, with a number of different paths and endings that encourage you to go back and play through it again, which I plan on doing, but honestly I don't think that quite makes up for the paltry third act and the neon flashing cliffhangar that screams for DLC.  To sum up:  Is it a bad ride? I'd say no. But I wouldn't say it's the most fun RPG I've played either. I don't think it's quite up to the standard set by other recent RPG's of the past few years, that's for sure. Does it have potential? Definitely, but we can't play potential. We can only play what we've been given and what we've been given is an okay game with okay writing, okay characters, and an okay story. Is it worth $45? Ehhhhhh. Maybe? Sort of? I'm definitely in the middling area on this one. Pick it up if you REALLY want to and enjoy Obsidian's games, but I'd still probably hold off for a sale. $25-$30 sounds like about the right price for this one out of the box.",1,0

875135,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"From what I had heard about Dark Souls, it sounded like the sort of game that would make you break controllers and maybe put your fist through your monitor with it's high difficulty. Now that I've actually given it a chance I find that while it's a very difficult game, it's never infurating (at least not to me). I get mad in games when I lose because of some random number generator in the code decides I took a critcal hit, or that my last 5 attacks missed, or some other issue thats out of my control. Dark Souls is never like that. If I die, it's my fault. Maybe I timed my dodge badly, or tried to take on too many enemies at once, or am just not geared properly. Most likely its because I had not learned how to correctly fight a particular enemy. So I die, a lot. But I learn more and come back the next time better prepared.   I do have some issues with the game though. For starters, you cant seem to remap controller buttons. I've never been a fan of attck on the bumpers or triggers, but you cant change that here without using 3rd party programs or ini file editing (didnt actually try that hard to change them). That should be a basic option. Also, you need a controller. Thats fine IMO because this would never be a good game for keyboard, however, the keyboard controls are almost unusable. Remaping might help, but it'll never be a good way to play. Do yourself a favor and just use a 360 controller.   Graphically the game looks a little dated, which is fine, cause it's a few years old. It comes locked a 30 fps, and has a few basic options for changing graphics. You can get mods which unlock the FPS and improve the graphics, which I strongly recomend.  I am not a fan of the multiplayer on Dark Souls. To me, this is a single player game. I find myself playing as a hollow the whole time just to avoid people invading my game. A few days ago I was stuck in the forest due to fog walls blocking the exits. I'm pretty sure someone invaded, and I couldnt leave the area till I either killed them or they left. No thanks. I'm bad enough at this game, I dont need people coming in and making it harder. I do like the way you can leave hints for other players on the ground though.  Overall, I came into Dark Souls expecting to hate it, and now I cant stop playing. I got it on sale for $7.50, it was totally worth it.",1,0
6193602,65790,Arma: Cold War Assault,"Arma: Cold War Assault (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis) is my most favorite game of all time for a reason. This is Bohemia Interactive's brilliant 2001 classic that started it all and set the bar for open world military simulators. No, this game doesn't look that pretty (although i'd argue the visuals were fairly good for their time), yes, it has clunky controls and movement mechanics, but oh man... once you really bite into the game and realize the openworld simulator potential.... holy crap this game still blows my mind 14 years later. No two playthroughs are ever the same, and in my opinion this one has the most robust and fleshed out single player campaigns out of any of the armas. It's definitely got a bit of a learning curve if you're not familiar with any of the ARMA games, and it's very difficult and unforgiving (I honestly recommend cadet difficulty if you're playing this for the first time, as this allows you more saves and HUD indicators/map icons that can be confusing for a first timer without). I'm currently playing through the campaign of this to get me pumped up for ARMA 3, as I plan on getting that soon. God I love this game in all its realistic glory!",1,0
6197767,65800,Dungeon Defenders,"It's fun, but the game is fundamentally flawed. It is way too easy to boost your rank to ridiculous levels by playing with higher-ranking players. It's true that you can avoid this by not playing with higher ranking players, but then you will be in for a long grind in which you slaughter the same enemies over and over again for more XP and loot. The game is fun to play for sure, but by the time you've grinded your way up to the last level, it probably wont' be anymore. So in summary, you have two choices.   1. A long grind that will likely make you hate the game by the end 2. Gain levels quickly by playing with high-level players and make your rank meaningless  I won't say I didn't have fun with this game.

1511623,22330,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ,"First off, I have over 300 hours in this game on Xbox so don't be fooled by my low playtime on steam. Secondly the fact that I have over 300 hours should tell you that this game is worth playing, if it isn't enough I break down what makes this such a great game and where its strengths and weaknesses are in this review.    Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an open world role playing game that emphasizes on player freedom, exploration and creativity. You play a prisoner of the imperial army who meets the emperor while he is trying to covertly get out of the city when a cult of assassins are killing members of the royal family to wipe out their bloodline. During the games tutorial you get recruited abruptly to help guard the emperor during this escape. Here you will get some insight on how to play the game and how the character progression system works as well as a taste of the lore of the elder scrolls universe. Once this brief but effective tutorial sequence is over you emerge a free man/woman free to do WHATEVER you want. You can take part of all number of activities and explore the vast province of Cyrodil; you can sink hundreds of hours into this massive very in depth game.    The things you can do are extensive in Oblivion. There is the main story which is engrossing and varied though a little on the shorter side. There are four guilds you can join complete with their own quest lines which are all fantastic and very interesting with cool characters and feel distinctly different from each other. There is the 'Fighters Guild' the 'Mages Guild' the 'Thieves Guild' and the 'Dark Brotherhood'. There is also the arena where you engage in gladiator style fights with some of Cyrodil's greatest fighters and most viscous beasts. You can also visit shrines of the various gods in the game and do quests for them, these are some of the best in the game and all are unique and yield cool rewards. There is also a plethora of quest's to do for the citizens of Cyrodil which are amazingly mostly unique and quite fun. There are countless caves, castles, and other locations to find and explore. There are houses through out the game you can buy and decorate ranging from shacks by the water the exquisite manors. Of course you can also spend hours on hours training your character and interacting with all the npc's in the game. The amount of content in this game feels endless and can be binge played all day, day after day with always more content seeming to pop up all over the place.    Oblivion takes place in Cyrodil as I mentioned earlier in the review, the central province in the continent of Tamriel. Cyrodil is the seat of imperial power where the Septim bloodline has reigned as emperor for generations. The Septim bloodline has a power, related to the gods themselves and they now face being wiped out by a sinister cult whose motivations are dark and mysterious. The Elder Scrolls series is rich with lore, Bethesda invented gods both 'good' and 'evil' with personalities and beliefs all unique from each other. The relationships the gods have with mortals are very interesting. You can spend hours reading the various books in the game learning about Tamriels history and learn more about the various groups and their own history, it's insanely extensive.    The gameplay is an interesting but mixed bag. The graphics look dated, the animations are clunky and the voice cast is extremely small for a world with so many people in it but it's pretty easy to overlook with all the goes right in the game. For combat you can use melee weapons ranging from swords to maces to axes as well as ranged weapons like bows. Magic is also very prominent in combat as well as for utility in the game. Combat is kind of stiff at times but it works fine and is easy to get the hang of. The leveling system is one of the elder scrolls’ biggest strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. You level your character by leveling your skills, these skills vary from 'Blade Weapons' too 'Lock picking'. Leveling you skills increases your overall level, so if you spending all your time leveling utility skills like 'Alchemy' and 'Athletics' but without leveling your combat skills like 'Destruction' magic or 'Archery' your character will be poor in combat which will make getting things done difficult. It’s also important to think clearly about what kind of character you want to make, this will determine what skills you should focus on leveling in the early game, once these skills are at an adequate level you can then branch out into other skills that are catch your interest. Leveling up other skills will allow making your character more malleable in different situations. Remember, solving all your problems by swinging an axe into people's heads isn't the best way to handle all situations. Also all the music in the game is fantastic.   In the end, when you take all the good and the bad together you have an imperfect but very awesome RPG. You can lose all your spare time for a long time with this game, and you will love every minute of it. The two DLC's that the game of the year edition comes with, 'Knights of the Nine' and especially 'The Shivering Isle's' are fantastic extra content, the latter is one of the best DLC's I have ever played. It's like a whole game in itself almost. This is a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anybody.   9/10",1,0

1134226,218620,PAYDAY 2,"This game is great, once you get past a couple of things: -Bugs that potentially screw over the entire heist (mainly if stealth) -Asshat infamy players who are extremely cocky and tryhard -Asshat lv. 10 players who are not only tryhard and cocky, but have lack of skill Keep in mind that this isn't stereotyping ALL of the infamies or lv. 10s. In fact, over 50% of infamy players I've met have been very courteous and had good sportsmanship. Haven't seen very many lv. 10s in a while though. But after you get past these things, you'll find the game very enjoyable. Overkill's done almost everything right: Enhanced leveling and skill trees, moderately priced DLC, free updates that do more than fix gameplay issues, etc. Keep in mind that graphics are the last thing I look for in a game, but the graphics in this game are amazing. I love Payday: The Heist, but the masks are horrendously rendered. In this game they look nearly exactly like they do in other media. The combat is good as long as you know what you're doing and you have good guns. The stealth makes little sense but is enjoyable (What I mean by makes little sense is that the civilians are nearly deaf unless you use unsilenced weapons, grenades, or a saw. Even yelling at civillians who are in separate rooms doesn't bother the main group.) and with proper teamwork, your crew is unstoppable.   TL;DR 9/10 Shut up Bain",1,1

2269469,241260,Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,"Story: Ok (1/3) ============= Graphics/Sounds: Great (3/3) ============= Gameplay: Good (2/3) ============= Replay Value: Low (0/1) ============= Total: Fare (6/10) =============  As a huge fan of the original stories, I always end up being disappointed in one way or another every time Frogwares makes a new Sherlock Holmes game. It is almost always the same experience: The games start great! You immediately find yourself at an enigmatic crime scene and get excited with all the newly added features and enhanced graphics and fall in love with the game within the first few minutes. However, Frogwares always successfully manages to let you down with a combination of inconsistencies in the plot, idiotic puzzles and graphical glitches. Fortunately Crimes and Punishments has a reasonably low number of these issues which makes it the least disappointing game in the series so far.  Crimes and Punishments has a different structure compared to the previous Sherlock Holmes games. It consists of 6 different cases with different possible endings. Two of the cases are from the original series and are very nicely implemented. For each case you need to collect some evidence and make conclusions based on your discoveries. The main problem with the story is that in most of these cases there is not much that you can do wrong, in other words, as long as you click on every object that you stumble upon and don't miss any evidence, it is always pretty obvious who the criminal is. This makes the alternate endings of each case superfluous and lowers the replay value of the game.  Both story and gameplay do not allow you to be very creative. There are two new vision modes added to the game. One allows Sherlock to notice subtleties that other people might miss and the other allows him to use his imagination and go back in time at the crime scene. These are supposed to be game-changing innovations that take the game to the 'next-level', but they fail to elevate from a mere visual effect that you need to turn on every time the game asks you to do so. The problem is that the game will automatically tell you when you need to use your powers. If the vision icons are not on the left corner of the screen, you will know that you are not going to discover anything new by using your vision modes anyway. So every time you use these abilities it feels like you are following orders instead of being smart. This might have been acceptable if you could turn these 'hints' off, or if this was an action FPS game, but in the adventure world you need to allow the players to be adventurous.  There are a few technical issues in the game, such as long and unnecessary loading screens, Watson getting in your way in small rooms or corridors and etc. which could have been easily avoided but I think the amazing graphics and sound acting make up for these annoying bugs and make the overall gameplay experience enjoyable. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan I absolutely recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale first. ",1,0

2626366,250320,The Wolf Among Us,"I LOVE THIS GAME  I was really into the comic Fables which this is based on and when I found out there was a game with Bigby Wolf as the main character and you get to solve murders I jumped on it. Now while I love it and I definitely recommend playing it there are some things you should know before you buy.  While you get to make decisions that are supossed to effect you later in the game it sort of feels miniscule in the grand scheme of things. Yes, all the episodes aren't out yet so I have no idea how everything plays out, but going through the game a second time with what is out so far, making radically different decisions from my first save doesn't seem to have changed anything drastically. I get all the same information, and in some cases the situations play themselves out exactly the same even if you handle them differently which is admittably frustrating. Especially since the game is based so much on choice.   Besides that the game is really fun and thrilling to play. The fight scenes are very well done (There's at least one for each chapter and I'm eager to see what they do with chapter 5), the dialogue has varied options that are fun to go through although it feels like it doesn't matter which option I choose except in few and far between *important* conversations. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and feel like real people. The voice acting is spot on and the graphics are pleasing. I have a lot of fun playing through the game multiple times and I think when the whole thing is out and I know how it ends I will go through it a couple more times.",1,0

1821946,230410,Warframe,"warframe is a great game the controlls on pc are a bit out of reach or just plain hard to get to. for instance to sprint is the (shift) button and to slide is the (ctrl) button the (shift) button must be held down to spring and sliding requires you to sprint. this however can be changed in contolls. also after a while it dose start to get a little slow and mabey boreing but overall a great game. it would help if the developers added more planets or recources because often times just having new warfames and wepons will not cut it due to the ability to buy them with real money.  the graphics are great and the gameplay is also great. walking through the missions and shoosting and cutting up grineer and corpus just feels so natural and also maby getting the chance to do some infested missions. all the charecters and enemies look quite stunning and the colors of the game are fantastic. the wepons also do some pretty cool stuff (e.g. pinning enemies to walls, blowing up enemies. ragdolling enemies). some of the animations on these wepons (depending on who you are) will make you wildly laugh.",1,0

3185188,268500,XCOM 2,"Solid improvement over XCOM EU/EW. I really enjoyed the change of pace and base management. A lot of the systems they changed felt like an improvement too. Offers a lot of replayability and character creation is a time sink as always.  I do feel that in some ways they could really improve the character customisation (more voice, armour, camo patterns, helmets, hair colour, etc.), even by importing older assets from the previous games. They seem to have left it to the enormous modding scene (they offer tools for this), which is a bit of a shame. Of course, that's not to say that the mods are bad - quite the opposite.  Yes performance is sluggish if you don't meet minimum requirements (and trust me, a GTX 560 is bare minimum at 1080p), but turning down the graphics settings will improve things (obviously). Definitely use a 2GB graphics card which is faster than a GTX 560. Running full screen seems to improve CPU load balance, but then I already have a fast CPU (i5 4690K) so it doesn't make much difference to me.

1735243,227940,Heroes & Generals,"(Edited as I wanted to put the review in more depth) Okay, so I've played Heroes and Generals for some time now. I really like the concept of the game, though it has its flaws.  Things it did right:  - The game. The game itself is a wonderful concept that has been made to the liking of many players.  - The guns. You can play as you want. You can buy a semi-auto or an auto rifle depending on your playstyle and upgrade it to your liking  - The modes. There are three main modes of play in Heroes and Generals: Assault, War and Skirmish. Each has its own difficulties and tactics.  Things it did wrong:  - Anti-cheat. This flaw is blatantly obvious, and can be noticed withing 10 or so games. There are a few main types of cheating in this: Wall hacking (Where the player can see other players through the walls), Aimbotting (The cursor tracks players), and XP / credit farming (where one player lets another get a LOT of kills on them, to farm XP and credits).  - Currency. This is well thought out in most places, but when the cost to repair your sniper rifle is more (Per shot) than you gain from a kill, it becomes an issue and you just end up waisting money.  - The players. Most team-mates dont actually care about winning the game or the objective. To them it is more of a CS:GO type of game than it is a strategy, which is what this game tries so hard to be, most players will either be absolutley terrible (Which I can understand, but the matchmaking levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold) should be sorted out) or they will be trolls and team kill or greif.  - Grenades... Oh boy, this one pisses me off. Grenades are not only the most over-powered pieces of ♥♥♥♥ in the game, but you can carry 3 per item slot (Meaning that a normal player can carry a max of 9 with no gun). Players seem to find it enjoyable that you can just throw these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s one after another until you kill the player you are trying to kill. I find this extremely stupid, as not only do these cost more to use than you get per kill, but RETO enforces the idea of using them.   RETO complains about losing money, but they only really have themselves to blame. You need to listen to your players. Think about adding / changing:  - The amount of carriable grenades  - The cost of repairs on certain weapons (As the recon class is now useless)  - An actually somewhat useful anti-cheat system  Aside from that little rant... love the game... would recommend..",1,0
717249,207170,Legend of Grimrock,"I really enjoyed this game other then some weird flaws that I felt were in the mechanics of the game. Straight up tanking the ememys is for the most part impossible unless you build the right team and know what perks to go after quick in the game. Most noobs wont know this, so the game becomes about running around to avoid getting attacked, shutting doors on enemys after you have attack to wait to attack again, and so on. I feel this kinda takes away from the game alote and give an odd dull feel. There seems to be lots of replayable contect and playing the game secend time around can still offer some fun on the harder difficulty and building a team better then what the stock game offers you the first time.

5274602,400160,Concrete Jungle,"I know nobody gives a rats ♥♥♥, but this game gets my vote for best indie game of the year. The art, voiceovers, feel, and most of all glorious unique gameplay are all absolutely top shelf. I could write pages and pages, and I would still feel that there wasn't enough evidence of the quality of this amazing game.  First, the wrapping paper. Concrete Jungle looks and sounds amazing. From the routine act of navigating the intricately illustrated menus to the explosive crackle of celebratory fireworks that follow a large swing in points, the look and feel of this game wraps the user in. The intricate and cozy detail on every one of the hundreds of unque buildings, the chest vibrating thump when a building is placed, the thumbnail art for each of the characters' skills all ooze charm. The game makes the player feel like a welcome guest.  The campaign perpetuates this welcoming atmosphere with well written and surprisingly well voiced cast of characters who, like good sitcom personalities, begin to feel like friends of the player. The banter between characters feels natural and spirited, and the comfortable progression of the missions introduces the player to a series of complex gameplay elements with casual charm.  The gameplay itself is extremely nuanced, especially because the same set of cards are used in a few very different gameplay modes. Concrete Jungle lives up to its promise of a city-building deck builder, challenging the player to plan their city by collecting points and thinking many moves ahead in solo mode, or by uplifting their own residents and punishing their enemys' in verses mode. The design of the game does strain a bit to balance the cards between these two very different modes, but both prove very entertaining, and both provide very different challenges. In both modes, however, planning ahead is a necessity, and tactics must be layered into strategies that stretch multiple turns into the future. The many different characters and huge variety of buildings available allow for a high level of replayability of a hugely entertaining game.  Concrete Jungle is a modern classic. It bucks every current trend in indie game development and delivers an beautiful experience that will certainly inspire future efforts. Pass it by at your peril!",1,0

2013008,23490,Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition,"I wasn't really a Tropico fan until this one. The original Tropico had a lot of good ideas in its individual citizens and its banana republic politics, but it was held back by technical limitations and short-sighted designs. After an odd detour with Tropico 2, the developers returned to the original concept and polished it up in a brand-new 3D engine, and the results speak for themselves.  Tropico 3 places you into the spit-shined spats of a Carribbean dictator, charged with helping his hapless little island flourish. Each individual citizen is modeled with needs, jobs, opinions, and motivations, so the key to success is keeping enough of them happy (or suppressed) to achieve your own agenda. This is mostly done by building homes and services they want, and making sure they have enough money to enjoy them. You'll be building churches, clinics, restaurants, casinos, and more, in addition to the farms and factories needed to fund them.  The big stumbling block of the first Tropico was that your little Tropicans couldn't be trusted to actually get ♥♥♥♥ done when it needed to be done. That's not a problem here, as your citizens spend far more of their time on their tasks and only go astray if their needs are very conspicuously not being met. And as it turns out, when your island is running like it should, the money just pours in. Even the most basic exports like excess food or meat will earn you everything you need to outfit your island. And once you get more complex industries up and running, money will never be an issue again.  As a result, Tropico 3 is way, way easier than its predecessors and a lot of its contemporaries, but this is by no means a bad thing. Economic prosperity allows you a lot more freedom to build your island the way you want, with all the services and luxuries you can stuff into your borders. You'll need them too, because your citizens are noticeably pickier than in previous games and won't hesitate to turn to armed rebellion. Some scenarios lean heavier on this aspect but managing the different factions and quelling uprisings are a larger part of the game, as they should be.  One very welcome feature added for this outing is the opportunity to customize your dictator. Tropico 1 let you choose his or her traits but 3 lets you give them backstories, change their outfits, and then watch them walk around and interact with the people. You can actually use your little avatar to inspire workers to work harder or give rousing speeches to the commoners. The traits also seem much more powerful this time around, and honestly work as a sort of difficulty system. Taking traits that help with scenario goals can make a huge difference, but you can also choose flaws that add a greater challenge.  In the end, Tropico 3 is the game the first one should have been. The core mechanics are not very far removed; most of the buildings and edicts are the same, and the politics are virtually unchanged. But everything works the way it's supposed to, is balanced to not be so frustrating, and is presented in some charming, picturesque 3D. There's no reason to go any further back in the series than this, so if you've ever wanted to lord over your own tropical island, start here.",1,0

Pros:  Messing around with the powers can be quite amusing.  Terrific Atmosphere.  Fun Acrobatics.  Cons:  The Story is...Pretty terrible, honestly. Incredibly predictable.  You're very encuraged to kill instead of sneak, seeing as most upgrades are for that purpose, whilst only 1 or 2 are for stealth.  I felt that I was far too powerful in the latter half of the game, it really took away from any tension.   Overall, it's a fun little game on it's own. However compared to the Thief games on merits of stealth, this pales in comparison.",1,0

2004661,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"Shadowrun Returns was a disappointment, plain and simple. While I love this style of game, and can easily see the potential of the path it could have taken, I instead find myself frustrated at how boringly linear it is. While you can techincally 'explore' as you walk around the numerous small maps that progress you through the campaign, I really never got the feeling that I was finding anything truly unique. I also never got the sensation that my actions or dialogue choices had any bearing on what was going on in the story. As far as I've gotten, I basically feel I'm playing an over-the-top version of Where's Waldo, as I look for the few clickable items per screen that will allow me to continue along.  Thus far, I've heard some pretty encouraging things about the recent DLC, but I am hesistant to spend more money on something that let me down so hard. I kind of wish there was a 'maybe' option for whether or not I recommend the game, but I'm leaning towards 'no', and so it will be.",-1,0

For too long I have been ♥♥♥♥♥ by this game so I think it was worth justing forgetting teh fun tiems that I had and remember the thousands of times I have died to some scumbag with a sniper rifle or some bellend at bellend corner...  This game is starting to give me a tumor, I can FEEL IT. It could be said that this game will killing me... I havent even played it long either like most reviewers like this, but the game just has no charm left.  Nothing about this game is balanced or close to logical, I die to some scumbag or lag or some wierd game mechanic 90% of the time with the 10% being an actual, worthy kill which makes sence and isnt insanely annoying or stupid... Worse still is that all the losers that hide in scembeg corner or in a window are the ones with the most kills, no the ones who use REAL guns with recoil and reloading and stuff, only ones with mgs or rockets or a sniper or something.

You can take your money safely, or bust in with the biggest gun you can get your hands on. The bigger the gun, the higher your detection rate. Your melee weapons have a detection rate too. You have to coordinate with your team (unless you're going solo) in order to successfully complete your heist.  You can choose which character you want via the masks, each character has their own special perks.   To unlock attatchments, you must complete heists and at the ending screen, you choose one of 3 cards, which have something underneath. It can range from paints for your masks to strait up weapon attatchments.The DLCs contain weapons and attatchments too.  In conclusion, the game is fun, complex and pretty difficult.

One of the nicest things about this game is the music, and even if it's not your favorite - you can setup to play whatever tracks (.mp3 for example) you have of your own!  The galaxy is 'procedural' so that it looks a little different in how the planets and systems connect to each other, however the main story line is the same.

6234231,70000,Dino D-Day,"Dino D-day is a great game. Unfortunately, the population is far too low and saturated with cheating. You might say 'Oh, just go to a different server,' but let me repeat: THE POPULATION IS FAR TOO LOW AND SATURATED WITH CHEATING. As in, at any given time, there is about ONE SERVER with a good amount of people on it, and on that server there is bound to be 2-3 cheaters on it. You simply CANNOT ESCAPE. If you leave the server, they are bound to follow if they want to annoy you because you are easy to track when only two servers have anyone on it.  Until Steam Vac gets rid of these cheaters and the developers fix their DLC, I can't recommend this game anymore. I suspect the cheating is the major reason why the population has not been able to grow.  You can still play with bots, but I doubt it's worth the price if all you are playing against is bots. There is NO campaign, and all the maps and gametypes are the same for bots and players alike.  In short: Fun game ruined by cheaters.  Update: I used to give this game a 'thumbs down', but the official release 'The Last Stand' DLC gives this game another chance. That said, there could have a better tutorial for the survival mode. I had to die several times, looking for the 'Quartermaster', only to learn later that you had to press a button to bring the buy menu up. Now, that's not normally a problem. Except the buy menu was not binded automatically.  It does not tell you this, and I pretty much had to figure it out by checking the controls. I dunno if rebinding the controls before the DLC came out had anything to do with it. However, it should at the very least mention that I needed to bind it, instead of just saying 'Quartermaster Available!' and making me look around for an NPC vender that does not exist. When the button is finally binded, it then says 'Quartermaster Availible! Press (key) to access!' Why doesn't it at least say 'Quartermaster Availible! Press' (although I would prefer 'Quartermaster Availible! Press (key not binded) to access!') so I at least know something is amiss?   Anyhow, so long as you find someone to play with the DLC looks promising. At least you don't have to worry about cheaters on the other team.",1,0

This game is not my piece of cake, but that still doesn't excuse me for how biased I was in my first review of this game. I have not played a while in the game (obviously) so my first point of the story being terrible is an un-based insult. I still think the tutorial is a bit corny, but its not as bad as I was making it out to be. My main concern that swayed me to call this game terrible was a PURELY opinionated reason, the controls. I am used to being able to click to use a skill, and then pointing where I want it to go, but this is not the case in Devilian. You shoot where you point, and this was entirely different from what I was used to. While I still don't like this control scheme, I'm glad one of the game developers commented on this, and forced me to look back on my review and realize it for what it was, trolling.

4996650,383870,Firewatch,"A wonderful good old fashioned adventure game with a very nice background, lovely graphics and great acting, to my surprise. When the story started I felt I would start to dislike the actors very soon but the opposite happened, I really got to like them.  (spoiler alert)  Only thing I might have added was a little more danger. Without giving away too much, I think having a bear somewhere and having the idea that the fire was actually dangerous, actually getting closer and that if I didn't hurry, it could actually kill me, would have made the game even better. At the end I just felt I had to run somewhere and would get there regardless of time or fire. I know, I'm a bit dark perhaps, but maybe an unhappy ending would have had an even greater impact. Imagine our hero getting stuck in the burning forest and knowing he will not make it out. Delilah somehow manages to connect you to your wife and even though you're never quite sure if she understands what is going on, you say your last goodbeyes while the smoke smothers you.

Match swords to attack monsters, match keys to open treasure chests. Every time, your goal is to meet the requirements so you can advance to the next dungeon, and fight tougher monsters for stronger items and more points.  There are two main flaws - the first is that the game is rather short. The second is that there is a little too much based on luck; for example, you might have a screen with no keys and run into treasure chests and nothing else. Actually hitting 10,000,000 points at the end is mostly luck.  Still, I've got to recommend this to anyone looking for a short, fun puzzle game.",1,0

The game is meant to be campy and tongue-in-cheek. All the jokes are pretty flat, but of course that fits the rest of the bill of a simple, casual, hidden object game. I had a couple of glitches, but they went away with a simple reloading of the game, so I can't really complain about anything here. Definitely worth the dollar if it's what you're into.  If you've played hidden object before, you know what your getting into. Nothing is advancing the genre here. If you haven't played hidden object before, if you're above the age of 14, you might want to start with a more interesting title.",1,0

3881588,304410,Hexcells Infinite,"It’s essentially minesweeper on a hexagonal grid with some extra bells &amp; whistles. The puzzles in the “campaign” portion of the game can be incredibly challenging to solve, but they don’t build much on the mechanics of the previous two games. Overall these puzzles were fun, but they didn’t exactly reinvent the wheel. A random, seed based puzzle generator is the main feature to be added to Hexcells Infinite. An essentially infinite number of puzzles can be generated, which was a feature noticeably lacking from the prior two games. Hexcells Infinite is simple enough to feel intuitive to anyone who’s played minesweeper, yet it can still remain challenging to veterans of the logic puzzle genre.",1,0

6372160,92000,Hydrophobia: Prophecy,"Starts off really promising with an interesting setting, rather intriguing plot and the promise of unique combat. Ends up being a cookie-cutter shooter with little extra mechanics. While the water looks rather well and the utilization is alright (the swimming mechanics I really liked, compared to many other games that make you swim and dive through areas) with the mechanics and the hydrophobia of the protagonist, hence the game's title, being displayed comprehensibly, the advertised water control mechanics only become available shortly before the game ends. Which means there is really little to be had, as the expected unique selling points are implemented poorly or just too late in the game.  The developers are bankrupt, apparently, and it seems as if they ran out of money halfway through the game. I really feel like this game was either supposed to be a trilogy or just a lot bigger. But about 2 or 3 hours in the story leaps ahead, you have a huge room where you must fight many baddies and then suddenly a boss fight, a short and unsatisfying cutscene and then ... nothing. That's it. Nothing is really concluded, nothing really happened. It seems like a prelude to the actual game, which will probably never come.  Might be worth a bargain price for the water experience, but otherwise expectations will probably fall short, as the game severely lacks substance.",-1,0

There is a heist in which you change the votes in the Republican's favour.  A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game about Donald Trump was released around the time of this update.  Donald Trump started from 'nothing' and created Trump Towers using shady methods. The update was about expanding your safe house using shady methods.  The game gives you clown masks at the start. Many people believe Donald Trump is a clown. Now that we established that Trumpo is behind the 'Killer Clown' ♥♥♥♥ we now know he wrote Steven King's 'It'  as the Killer Clown trend is coming out before the reboot  IT contains supernatural elements. What else is super natural? Thats right, 'Harry Potter'. In 'The Deathly Hallows Part 2' Magicians break into Gringots Wizarding bank and escape on a dragon. There is a character in Payday called Dragan.  If we take into account that Donald Trump created Payday (as seen in the evidence above) we know he is magical as he also was behind Harry Potter.  This means Donald Trump will win the elections using Magic.  When Donald Trump wins the elections Payday 3 will come out.  Only this time it will posses our minds and make us shoot up schools.  This will make people think video games cause violent behavior so they will flock to Payday 3 to see in what ways it causes you to be violent. More people will buy the game thus giving Trump more money!  ......oh yeah Payday 2 is good...Almost forgot to mention that!  ",1,0

1845929,231160,The Swapper,"I wanted to write an actual recommendation instead of single sentence I previously wrote. So yeah, I liked this game a lot. The Swapper obviously draws comparisons to similar gun-based physics-puzzlers Portal or Gateways, but with the twist that you are creating and killing your own clones to progress through the space station. It's not the most innovative or complicated puzzle mechanic, but it is backed up by a great sci-fi story and some increasingly challenging obstacles. I'd like to boast that I completed the game without the help of any guides, but that would be a lie. And every time I had to reference a guide to complete a room, I always thought: 'well, durr, of course that's how it's done.' So, challenging but not cheap or too complicated.  I would put the story in the same vein as the film Moon or the novel/film Solaris. It's great sci-fi that gives you enough to get the gist of what has happened but leaves plenty of blanks for you to fill in. Worth the price if you are into these types of games, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it in a Humble Bundle at some point if you wait. And, holy crap, the ending!",1,0

2347888,242700,Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition,"I have an odd relationship with Injustice on PC. On console I got it when it came out, played the story 2-3 times, owned multiplayer lobbies. I got it for PC for the DLC and so I can play while talking with my friends. First reactions: graphics are good. Second reaction: Buggy as crap. The fight was slow motion because when the game was ported from console it was still frame dependent or independent or whatever, meaning they churned out every frame even if the pc couldn't handle it. Most games turn down the FPS if the console isn't good enough and yet thats not how Injustice rolled because hey it works on console, but on pc it made Batman walk slower then a turtle in molasses. This is bad but then kabambam found a fix online and it's good as new. The game is fun, unique to MK but has the same style as it, lots of well known heroes but also vague ones for hardcore fans. Costumes, good story. My one complaint, however?  Multiplayer. Multiplayer in this game is amazing, it gives the highest replay value to all fighting games and I:GAU does it greatly. You can find a single opponet, or you can join lobby-esque rooms where you can challenge people or chill and chat with people. You can find (my favorite) Survivor/KOTH matches, where there's like 5-6 people but there's 1 fight at a time. You lose? Back to the bottom of the list. You win? Fight the next guy. Survivor is just KOTH but when you win you keep the amount of health you had when you won, preventing good people from bein up there forever. You can even bet on who will win, chat with people in the lobby. It was awesome and fun on console when the game came out, yes. But the actual complaint? NOONE PLAYS MULTIPLAYER. I mean, literally not one person. I have sat searching for koth, survivor, single matches and not one, not even being dragged up into higher levels or down into lower level opponets. Find a room? Every single room has 0 people. So to fix my only complaint you guys should totally add me and play with me hahahah please.  So, in conclusion or TL;DR game is GOOD little buggy but worth it. Preferably buy it on sale because 30 bucks yeesh but it comes with a GOOD amount of DLC which some people paid 30 bucks for on its own. Most serious issues have fixes on google so find it and then when you're ready to face those people online to hone your skills there wont be any. Sucks. I give this 10/10 solely so more people will buy it and play online.",1,0

201604,107410,Arma 3,"Cod for kids, battlefield for teens, arma for adult  Arma 3 is the sequel to the successful arma series. We cannot simply define Arma as a simple FPS game; it's more than a military simulator. Everything in the game is build to mirror their real life counterpart to the most extent from recoil, sound, bullet physics,.. You are a 'real' soldiers on an actual battlefield in which the weight you carry will affect your movement and aiming. You will not be able to sprint infinitely and have laser beam like accuracy like in COD or battelfield. The fatigue system however is a little it overwhelm in the vanilla game but can be fix with mod. In the single player campaign, you play as a normal soldiers involved in an actual conflict, not a superhero that save the world from nuclear crisis. The campaign definitely lacking a proper story and your decision does not influence the ending that much. Vehicles in this game are the absolute beast in this game unlike Battlefield. However, you will not a have a health pool or get repaired with a blowtorch like in battlefield. If the enemy punch through your armor and damage your crew, you're done. Since the landscape in this game is gigantic and so many things have to be render out, you computer will take a hit on frame-rate unless you have a $2000 rig. The editor and mods will fill in the end game content. This game offer a great replaylability and you will see people still play this game after 5-6 years from now. Only buy the game if you enjoy a good military sim, it has a big learning curve but you will enjoy it if you take times to explore the game.",1,0

1300270,220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is two games.  The first 2/3 of it is an open world first person shooter that lets you control the pace. You can go hunting for wild animals, attack enemy bases, and tackle the vast majority of the missions in any way you want, whether that's via stealth or dudebroing it up, or whatever. It really is exceptionally good fun!  The last 1/3 is just... well... it's linear, it's boring, it's Call of Duty-esque gunsplosions, i.e. gameplay is driven by linear environments with checkpoints, and progress is through attrition rather than player ingenuity. All of these are symptoms of a game that has lost its way towards the end, or christ, even had another team entirely working on it.  Sure you *can* still explore the open world in the last third, but the impetus and momentum at this point is on beating the game rather than unlocking ♥♥♥♥, since doing it is for its own sake at that point (earlier on in the game, side missions are to get XP to strengthen your character in order to tackle the tough story missions). The game even acknowledges this by raining ammo packs and body armour down on you at the end of each story mission at this point so you don't have to spend time going to restock.  Couple this with a predictable plot, lame characters and a rather binary sense of morality, and Far Cry 3 is an okay, if not amazing, product. I can recommend it, since I felt compelled to finish it, but be warned: the last third of the game is really lame whereas the first two thirds are really quite good. Just be sure to get the game when it's cheap.  6/10",1,0

Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple, and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: 'Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!'  'I will do my best to save him, my Lord,' Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.  Again, the voice called to her: 'Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.'  'I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,' Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.  One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her: 'You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.'  'Yes, Lord. Anything,' Isaac's mother begged.  'To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!'  'Yes, Lord,' she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug.

1919379,233130,Shadow Warrior,"I really want to recommend this game but I can not. It looks gorgeous and I even like the stupid humor and the oneliners. The story makes a solid impression but unfortunately the gameplay is just boring. The levels are arenas interconnected by corridors, it might look like you walk trough the city but from the game design ist just corridors and arenas. Don't get foooled by the first few levels where the bamboo forest might look nonlinear. This game has very linear levels. There maybe some backtracking but its just one path up and down.  But the worst is the fighting. It just gets tedious. There is no strategy, no cover.....it just more and more enemies against your button press skills. Later on every arena is filled with multiple 'mini bosses' and you try every arena several times until you killed them all. Sometimes it was just luck for me or two minibossed got stuck or something.  This game really starts great but ends up very tedious and boring after a third or so. It's such a shame actually, because the sword fights are easy, fluid and fun. But after maybe a third of the game it just is no fun anymore...its feels like work...very repetitve. I got it like 75% off and I do not regret it much but I can't really recommend it if you like older fast paced shooters. Maybe the CoD or console crowd will enjoy Shadow Warrior...I could not.   --- Have a look at my channel  https://www.youtube.com/user/phoppe1980 ",-1,0

It looks better than decent indie game, gameplay mechanics are fun (stoping time for the win!), levels aren't too easy but also not so hard if you spend some time thinking to discover secrets and such. Maybe it's sci-fi setting that will make it easy to forget - there is nothing that could make me 'wow'. Same goes for story and music. Boss fights are rather boring and very easy. Also, game is very short. Even with stats for each level (score and time), with achievements, you don't really need much time and effort to get everything and reach some satisfactory position. Heck, even without trying, I reached top 10 on some levels.  For a price tag in my region, which is 9 euro, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I got it for cheap, but still don't think it was worth the price. There are tons of similar games, better ones, cheaper, with more interesting setting, plot twists, gameplay mechanics.

3363919,275850,No Man's Sky,"Despite all the negativity around this game I love it. However I have been lucky and not had any of the issues with stuttering and FPS drops!   Specs; GTX 980, 16GB RAM, Core i7 4770K, MSI Z87-G45 Gaming motherboard.  For me the game is how i expected it to be which is a space exploration game with minimal crafting mechanics. Despite the mention of in-game multiplayer from the devs, it isn’t there. For whatever reason they decided, maybe a decision was made to remove it or hold it back as an update, either way I don’t mind because the game is so massive that even if I did play with friends or online I probably wouldn't see anyone anyway.   The game does have some flaws though. As mentioned before, the first is the FPS issues, second is multiplayer and the third is the repeated assets on every planet. The planets themselves are actually pretty interesting in terms of diversity and explorability.  As an exploration game with limited story it is what you make of it, if you are the kind of person that can spend hours exploring a planet to the brink of time and finding every discoverable discovery, then the game is perfect for you. If that isn’t your cup of tea (or you prefer coffee) then don’t expect to find much in the way of action, mass murdering or huge set pieces as this is a slow paced exploration game.  As I’ve already said I love the game and even if it didn’t work I wouldn’t give it a thumbs down, because the problems are rudimentary and can be easily fixed, content can always be added and will be added, for free! I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good exploration game but I would also advise you to be patient and wait for the fixes to come in before committing to a purchase.  Overall 8/10. ",1,0

Epiphany is a few hours longer than previous entries in the series, and while some of the plot points are a bit far fetched, it's absolutely worth seeing how it all plays out.  If you haven't played any of the Blackwell games yet, I still highly recommend them. The pixel art looks great (at least in my opinion), the voicovers are good, though some characters in the earlier entries are a little weaker, and the stories of each game are all strong on their own, and even stronger when taken together as each new game has more events to reference back to.  I found the puzzles in this game were a little stronger than previous entries - what I had to do next made sense, without being overly obtuse. I'll admit I did look up a walkthrough once, but even then what I'd missed did make sense. If you do choose to pick up this game, try not to look things up unless you're really stuck - the feeling of solving a tricky puzzle is worth it.

5843272,495350,,"You are probably wondering why I am posting a review with only 0.2 hours spent in the game. I am very happy to inform you that this playtime is actually why I've written this review. Let me paint you a picture, for starters.   A great friewnd of mine had purchased this game for me as a gift, and we both thought that it had some potential to be fun. Upon loading into the game, I was immediately confused because the camera is inverted by default. This, however, is not the reason for my hatred of this game. That part comes is only a little bit. The story of the game is delivered in a most confusing fashion, but that is mostly forgiven because of the story's simplicity. Why go to extreme lengths to explain a simple 'go find the thing' plot anyway? I had only gotten to the first steps of the first area for the second time (because of an unfortunate and unexplained death) when my character was removed from the game world entirely. I was not 'glitched into a wall', or 'set out of bounds'. My game did not even crash. I was simply gone. Removed. Unable to find any trace of myself or my influence upon the game world. My camera was forced to bear witness to the side of a wall for all of eternity. I did nothing out of the ordinary to warrent such a bug or glitch, all I know is that I shall refund this game immediately. I don't know whether this game is actually good; I only ever saw a fraction of the first level. If I were you, dear reader, I'd not take the risk of paying money for this game, even with the promise of a refund in mind. You may be able to get your money back, but your time is forever lost should you encounter an experience similar to my own.  SOMEWHAT INTERESTING NOTE: After posting this review initially, one of the developers of the game responded to it and asked for more information regarding this glitch. This act shows that the devs are working hard to fix such problems in the game as what I have experienced. I am very happy to say that I have some more faith in the integrity of game developers now, and the creators of this game have my respect for showing initiative in finding the cause of this srange glitch. Thank you, developers, for listening to your fans and audience in a time where other game-makers would simply ignore them. P.S. The dev's comment can be found in the replies to this review, unless the comment is deleted for some reason.",-1,0

This is one of the few games that has been released in recent times to have caught my attention so well and for so long. The only downside of the game is that the mission becomes tedious as you progress through the game. The layout of the mission is different and that is the only thing. If the game featured more different style of mission instead of just using your hacking skills to infiltrate, eliminate all the enemy, and get out before reinforcement comes, this game would be 10/10.   Still a great buy and a fun game",1,0

I of course haven't played everyone of them but I've played a few and watched a few others. The story is so in depth, I love it to death. The creators of this had the idea of 'ain't nobody not gonna know how our magic works' because if something magical is happening, they will tell you the ins and outs of how it is currently happening.

2910665,255070,Abyss Odyssey,"Incredible value for such a high-quality production. Graphics, music and overall presentation are AAA. There is a ton of nuance to the way it plays. I found that I wasn't doing very well by button mashing, but when I started thinking of it more like a fighting game and not a brawler I did much better. Enemies don't stand still or move in the same patterns. They each have their own unique moveset like any fighting game character, making battles dynamic and challenging.  Your character level and gold (and some other things, I'm still learning) are saved between each play session but the game world is re-rolled each time you jump back in. This can force you to have very long sessions if you play until you die. I hope they modify it so you can save the world state at a certain point. It's tough to devote a long stretch of time for one playthrough.  Overall, highly recommended if you are into roguelikes and games with deliberate animations/controls like Dark Souls. Not recommended if you are only looking for a beautiflu, story driven platformer.",1,0

5018901,385370,Radiator 2: Anniversary Edition,"For such a short game, there really is a lot to say about Radiator 2; big things come in small packages. I'd first heard of Robert Yang, the developer, when his game Stick Shift became the topic of video game controversy a year or two ago. To be blunt and simple, Radiator 2 is not for homophobic wastes of skin, as the three games that lay inside the title are filled with homoerotic content. With that being said, not only those who are gay will have a good laugh here.  First up, we have the BDSM-driven Hurt Me Plenty, in which you spank your lover. You can do this either soft and gently, or go to town on his butt cheeks and make him cry in pleasure and ecstasy. Once you're all done with the master-slave scenario, you get to massage him to show after-play care. This mini game is meant to symbolize the consent/caring portion of BDSM communities, and prior to the spanking session your AI partner will display symbols for you in almost a 'safe-word' kind of manner.  Succulent is a whole different type of game, that's not much more than an elaborate music video about fellatio. You control a studly bear-looking guy who just happens to have a long, dong shaped ice cream. By moving your mouse, you cause him to suck and lick the treat right down to the wooden stick. The more intense you get, and the further the ice-cream melts, the deeper it goes into his throat and cheeks, and the weirder the music video gets with the two guys on either side of the one you're controlling massaging their junk. This title symbolizes nothing but sweet, sticky sucking action.  Finally we get to Stick Shift, which is... you guessed it, an auto-erotic night driving simulator. This game is the harder of the three, and in order to win it you must reach sixth gear. You can use your mouse to pump the stick shift up and down, which causes your car to rev in pleasure and excitement; although this does not have much to do with completing the simulation. After predetermined amount of time, you're able to shift into the next gear; each time you gear shift, the main guy goes pleasure crazy until there's a nice load of spunk dripping from the exhaust pipe at the end. However, there is a possibility of being pulled over by the cops on each playthrough, and it's random.  There's also a special hidden mini game that can be accessed by clicking the condoms that are on the bed of the main screen. This is a first-person shooter simulator, where you must stare at the underwear-clad packages of men in an adjacent building through a sniper rifle scope, and shoot a condom at them so that they can have ultra safe protected sex. This game also attempts to have a small storyline, which is rather humorous.  After you finish every game, a timer pops up and tells you the amount of time you have before you can play that particular segment again. If you happen to be pulled over by the police in Stick Shift, you have the option of blowing them kisses which just makes them angrier, and makes your timer go up. Hurt Me Plenty has the longest cool down of all, at five days. The controls can be a little stiff and hard to get used to, but once your hand gets lubed up with sweat it makes it a lot easier to keep pumping your mouse for maximum efficiency.  The long and thick of it is, Radiator 2 is a pretty funny game in small doses. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this content being on Steam, in my opinion, especially since we have so many visual anime novels with nudity in them already. This game is simply, well... flamboyantly gay, and that's absolutely alright. Radiator 2 should be avoided by people with no sense of humor and intolerant fools. The play time will last roughly 30-60 minutes, depending on how many times you fail Stick Shift, and you will... trust me. If you like crude content that has a funny side, then go on and give this one a shot; you've got nothing to lose, it's free.   Rating:  4.0/5.0  - Excellent, highly worth playing.",1,1

5499553,429180,Project CARS - Pagani Edition,"I'm very happy that there was an opportunity to play 'Project Cars' for free, after deliberation on whether to add this to my collection or not, I finally have my answer.  It's not going to be a purchase for me.  Racing games are held in a market at the moment where the big titles cover pretty much all corners of the racing genre. from Dirt, NFS, Forza, GT. Project Cars offers nor brings anything new to the table, nothing stands out and it does very little to try. Simulation is done better elsewhere as is arcade racing.  The graphics on the cars are nice, however it's painfully obvious that's where the team have spent most of their time. The cockpit modes are beautifully detailed with the ability to actually take a view inside the drivers helmet and a rare mid-seat (between driver and passenger) view. However car detail is already something Forza nailed 3 editions ago, shiny cars is not a big selling point anymore, NFS have been doing it for years.  This means the enviroments of the tracks are not as well established as the cars, there is something eerily arcadey about the graphics I can't quite describe. It could possibly be the over saturation of the colours that gives the vibes of Ridge Racer rather than Gran Turismo.  The car mechanics are serviceable, the power cars rip from your grip if your not gentle on the gas. It's nice to lose control if your not paying attention. However this seems to be a little bit on the sensitive side, a steady pace on a straight will not send a car suddenly veering off into a 360 spin if the controls are not handled.   Something with the reverse of some of the cars is also off, they seem to have the turning circle of a cruise ship. Trying to reverse in a 180 can find your car taking a long time to actually move in any angle of note and ram from one side of the track to another. It's like controlling a 1 wheeled shopping cart.  The many configurations for major racing wheels and other lower market ones are great, if you use a wheel it's likely to have an option for you.  In summary it suffers from the lack of any real purpose. It adds nothing other titles haven't already covered, instead ticking all the tropes the genre has done time and time again including an overused cliche talking menu. Very Dirt 3.  5/10    ",-1,0

2602095,24960,Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,"First frostbite battlefield to also be ported to PC, that means it has huge destructibility and some great physics. Game looks really good for requirements it asks for, has variety of colors and smooth lightning.   Game's campaign is nothing original, story is pretty much what you expect from modern military shooter now-days, with predictable sequences and plot twists. It lasts about 8 hours and takes you in places around the world. But main characters are funny with some great dialog. To be honest i even enjoyed it, that said first 3 hours were really boring. If you are completely new to battlefield series and to modern military fps's I advice you to play it through, but if you are experienced than you probably can skip it.   So what about Multiplayer ? First of all, servers are working, are quite populated, and I never have had problems finding full server with low ping in my region! Only problem you might run in to is that most of the players are experienced and with maxed out stats, so in the beginning game can be really hard, but there are servers which allows only noob players.  There are enough maps, with different environments such as country sides, deserts, jungle or snowy forests. They are really thought out and with destructibility they never look they same, so it makes hard time for campers and it makes you always improvise in general. However some maps are bit harder to play in rush mode if you are attacker.  MP has addictive leveling system. Balanced perks and specializations. Classes have their own unique equipment, but there are some weapons which are available for all classes so in some situations it's quite useful. There are a lot of weapons, and some attachments to them. Also game features several WWII weapons which can be used by all classes. Only I found MG's bit less powerfull than others.  Vehicle controls and combat are really fun, but takes some time to master. There are ground, air and water vehicles.  So to sum it up.  Campaign is nothing new, but definitely not the worst-one and to be honest I found it worth playing. MP is really great, well balanced, addictive and has a great variety of weapons and vehicles . Has some minor problems which you'll probably ignore.  Servers are populated and always running.   So i gave it 8.2.  Thanks for reading!",1,0

UNLIMITED amounts of builds to cater to your gameplay style! INSANE amounts of maps i'd say 10x bigger than Skyrim all together as there are massive cities/territories and endless places to indulge in exploration. Last but not least, PVP is insanely exhilarating i mean HUNDREDS even maybe a THOUSAND people in some battles, literally.

No, I have just finished the game not more than 10 minutes ago, and managed to grab all 3 endings in the process. I will tell you right now, although games like Oblivion and Portal cloud my top 5 favorite games with the ham fisted strength of  nostalgia , this game is one of the greatest games I have ever experienced. The stealth is near-superb, with the only hiccups being that bodies will go undetected and JC will be chewed out for killing, even though everyone was rendered unconscious. I played through the game utilizing only the stealth crossbow, taser, and police baton in a fruitful effort of not killing anyone, but the beauty is that you can play through however you want. Depending on how you allocate your skills, you can speed through maps toting a nuclear death launcher or a small machine gun, paving the way with bullets. You can be cautious and invest in disabling security, then sneakily headshotting enemy troopers. Or you can be like me, and be the ghost that is never seen.   All of the above only focuses on the gameplay aspect. The story? Fantastic. It has the right amount of plot deviations and well versed story telling that surrounds itself in conspiracy. The graphics? They are subpar, but for the year 2000, not too bad. The soundtrack? While it is very 2000-centric in nature, it still holds up very well and fits the mood of the area. It will leave your ears wanting more and more.  So, do I recommend this game? Yes. Yes, very much so. No matter what your playstyle is, the game will fit it like a glove.

1049265,215630,Demonicon,"This is a game that I picked up rather randomly, with the only intention being to pass the time with...that turned around into getting 'into it' and finishing it over the course of this week. The first thing worth noting is that I wish that the steam review system allowed for Neutral Reviews, because this is one particular game that I feel falls into neither one side or the other, but kind of in-between, depending on the player.  That said, I won't elaborate much on the story, because I feel that the game's description does an adequate enough job and I prefer to avoid spoilers. However, worth noting is that the story is one of the stronger points that this game has, it's interesting right from the very beginning and hooks you in. It's a shame though, because it kinda falls through near the end, I personally didn't like the ending, but that's just me and I think the game would have benefitted from more choice and consequence dialogue options, beyond the few choices you get to make at critical points in the story. Then again, maybe I'm asking for too much and should go play a Bioware RPG then? Regardless, what choice and consequence options there are, are pretty interesting and thankfully, aren't simply a matter of 'good or evil' and instead, as previously stated, choice and consequence options. For example *SPOILER ALER!!!* the first such option has you deciding between letting a cannibal go and saving his captives, with the obvious conseqence of letting him run free and keep eating humans, or killing him, which at the same time, will kill his captives because they are bound to his life by a spell. I actually had to give this decision a few moments of thought before deciding, and when a game makes me stop to think, I believe it's done something right.  Moving on to the gameplay, the core of it is typical Action/RPG fare. Standard attacks, skills and magic are your options in combat. Standard hack and slashing consists of stringing together attacks into combo chains, the higher your combo chain, the higher the chance of scoring critical hits and after a certain amount, you start recovering hit points every time you hit an enemy. Also at your disposal is a dodge function and skills that you can learn with Adventure Points (AP) which you earn through combat and completing quests among other methods. Magic is learned using Gift Points (GP) which is strictly earned through combat and tied to how often you use magic. Finally, there are more geenric skills that are helpful throughout the game, such as Blacksmithing, which allows you to disarm traps and upgrade weapons, Lock Picking which allows you to, well...Pick Locks, Fast Talking which opens up optional disalogue choices and Lore which allows you to gain extra insight into people, places, enemies and so on, in the form of more information being unlocked in your journal and it also opens up more optional dialogue choices. Complementing everything, is Alchemy Crafting which allows you to brew Potions, Poisons and make Balms, unfortunately I cannot comment on that feature, as I mostly ignored it, because I went for the achievement for completing the game without using any potions and Blacksmithing, which allows you to upgrade weapons with components that you buy, or find in chests or get as rewards for completing quests. With gameplay in general, I had a few issues, while combat is easy to grasp, it also felt too simplistic and while some of the skills and magic are definitely useful, they didn't really stand out for me in terms of being 'fun to play with', also, one of the things that immediately come to mind when I think of an Action/RPG, is loot, lots of (hopefully) varied and fun to tinker with, loot...most of the loot in this game is generic and not really interesting, and I hate...let me say it again, I HATE, that the game only has two different melee weapons: Swords and Clubs...I mean, really? Oh, wait...no shields either. Finally, the end fight disappointed me, it was a push over and probably the easiest boss fight in the entire game.  Graphics and Sound...probably where this game fails at quite miserably, wallows in the mud and then gets stomped on by a passing horse. No, really...it's THAT bad. Graphically, this game looks like it belongs in the early 00s, while the atmosphere is spot on, giving the game a less 'Fantasy' and more 'Realistic' setting, the graphics are bad at best. Adding insult to injury, a lot of the animations during cutscenes are cringe-worthy or plain don't exist, like an NPC handing the main character an item and the main character supposedly examining it, which is suggested, but isn't animated, unless you use the imagination and imagine it. What animations are there, are mostly cringe-worthy as I mentioned before, like the main character awkwardly drawing his sword and looking as if his about to fall backwards because of it's weight. Another complaint is the design of the game world, while the atmosphere is great and lends itself to the plot quite nicely, at the same time...it doesn't have a whole lot of variety and not much in terms of interesting things to see. Finally, generic music and sound and mostly awful voice acting, some people have praised the voice work on this game and I guess to each their own, but in my opinion, it's horrible.  Final thoughts: This game had a lot of potential, but instead was ruined. The game is rather short, the first chapter itself spans about half of the time you'll spend playing this game, which gives you false expectactions as it sets the stage to make you believe that each chapter will be similar in length, but their not. More interesting side quests and less linearity may also have helped, but most of all, better graphics, at least for a game that came out in 2013. Oh and is asking to be able to skip cutscenes too much? &lt;_&lt;  Ultimately, I recommend the game, why? Because despite it's flaws, it's still an enjoyable game, if you can get it for 75% off, as it's NOT worth the full asking price.",1,0

4235776,32510,LEGO® Star Wars™ III: The Clone Wars™,"Lego Star Wars III - The Clone Wars follows the TV series: Star Wars - The Clone Wars. How well it does, I don't know, as I haven't regularly watched the show. It did, however, let me play through the very few parts of the show I remembered, so I'll have to leave how well it followed the show to the assumption that it does a decent job.   As for the level design, there are plenty of good levels in this game, but are sadly overshadowed by the abundance of strategic open battlefield levels. You have to destroy enemy bases and build your own. It's fun and makes for a great side activity to be included (as it did in the game's Republic Assault missions) but it's also put in place of some of the actual story missions which just seems a bit lazy to me.   The controls feel like the other Lego Star Wars games (I used a gamepad controller) but with what I would consider a major improvement. They removed the short combos from the previous games and replaced it with the ability to fight indefinitely. One thing I do miss, however, is the ability to use stronger lightsaber attacks by timing your next move instead of button mashing.  Overall, I love this game but wouldn't give it a perfect score.",1,1

2652912,250600,The Plan,The Plan is quite an extraordinary game about a little fly trying to escape. At first I found it quite boring then I was in awe by its beauty and then I was horrified and screaming WTF at my computer. I have to say the ending is quite suprising and it kind of made me feel sad because of the loveliness of the middle part. I am not a fan of games that are short end abruptly and are more emotianal than downright awsome but this game. This game made me take that all back. I have only played it once and that was amazing. You have to be patient and be a bit of a gamer that likes amazing things in gaming like when 2 characters are reunited and that little spark of happiness ignites inside you and when you get to witness beautiful things that the game company has made and you are just speachless. I mean I like beating the poop out of villians in Batman or going on a kill spree in Call Of Duty but sometimes its good to take a break from that and witness the more fragile and inspiring side of gaming sometimes as well. This game deserves a place in there but the ending doesn't.,1,0

It is extremely satisfying when your team starts to pull together and outmatch the enemy team in upgrades, map control, or just plain coordination.   This game is not for people who like to be lone wolves. If you do not work with your team, you will die. That is a simple truth of the game and one of the main reasons why I like the game so much.  However, there is not always an active server to join. Sometimes I have had trouble finding a server that had an open slot or a good amount of people in it. When I do find a server though, the experience is incredibly fun and I am glad that I bought the game. (It is not too hard to find an active server most of the time)  Overall, if you like strategic shooters or want to feel like a real colonial marine, get the game.  P.S.

Everything feels fluid and even realistic enough to not make it mundane and overly complicated. The damage from grenade and even their explosions feel real. They arent fire crackers that kill you only if you are 5 ft away. Overall, this is a great game. With every update there are things added that make the game more fun rather than just adding pointless things. What I mean is, when an update comes out, you can actually be excited about it and look forward to it. Unlike majority of other games I have seen.

Pros: 1: you get to collect all these pretty coins that will further improve the playable characters, it can be quite difficult to collect some. 2: you get to see luffy and shanks fight each other,ain't something to get to see so soon in the anime/manga  Cons: R.i.p keyboard if you do not have a gamepad while playing this game. The amount of keys usage is so high, you wish the keyboard you have has a life-time warranty so you can exchange for a new one every now and then.

3880722,304240,Resident Evil,"A welcome development from Capcom, this game contains the core elements of survival-horror genre within Resident Evil (RE) franchise. The setting is frightening, monsters are plentiful (some even break through the windows and doors to attack), camera angles are fixed, and ammo is limited; therefore players are likely to experience fear and nostalgia while exploring areas and proceed with caution. In addition, macabre puzzles and deadly traps make sure that players cannot take this game lightly as it progresses but are forced to explore most areas for clues and solutions.   Progress can be saved with use of ink ribbons and typewriters, but ink ribbons are found in limited quantity and typewriters are located in select-few areas, therefore the act of saving progress in this game may give the vibe of a tactical challenge.  Even though this game is a remake of the original version that was released in 1996, it is significantly improved with new content, expanded setting, more frightening atmosphere, and more menacing monsters. This game also features two types of control schemes; original and alternate. Players can try both control schemes to determine which works best for them. Personally, I recommend original control scheme for Old School fans of the franchise. In short, this game is a refreshing update to the original version and is just as exciting for the first-timers who have played the original version but not the 2002 remake version.   In the nutshell, this game is a masterpiece of survival-horror genre and highly recommended for fans of RE franchise and also for fans of survival-horror genre content in general.",1,0

It's fine to run it once and never again. It's not bad idea for game - fighting with zombies inside plane, outside plane and while flying is nice idea. I really like it. But how everything is done... it's tragic. The most funny thing is probably translation from google - so if you see your language on that list it was mostly poorly translated using google translate. The game alone gets boring really fast and if you managed to run it twice or more times: you probably don't have better things to do or don't have anything more interesting to play. Don't waste your time and your money on games like that: it's not worth it.",-1,0

This entire season was just one kick in the nuts after another. Yes, it triggers that part of us that makes us determined to fight it out anyway but come on!

5114233,391540,Undertale,"Note that I haven't even started to plumb the depths of this game but I feel compelled to leave a review anyway.  This game had so much buzz online that I was immediately resistant to trying it, out of a weird defiance, so when I did start playing this game, it was with preconceived expectations that I wouldn't like it and that it would not live up to the hype.  I was wrong.  This game slowly and completely immersed me in its little world. The music is simple yet brilliant. The characters are vividly imagined and their dialouge is cleverly written.  You aren't told too many rules explicitly, you learn how to play as you go along. When you equip different weapons, for example, you don't realize how to fight with them until you get into your next encounter. I found this interesting and engaging, and for that reason, it made me want to try out a variety of weapons rather than sticking with the first thing I equipped.   As for the story itself - you make many choices as you go along, and they do impact how the plot develops. You feel the consequences of some choices you make, and you sometimes feel like you are the villain in the game after all. The monsters become more human by the minute, and you feel like your 'human' character is not much different from them.  I will not lie, I felt increasing regret for killing a specific character in a boss fight. As I kept playing and learned that there are various ways to lead encounters so that you can Spare monsters (and as such, don't have to kill them), I ended up resetting the game so I could start all over again and spare that character.   Normally, video games have bosses that you are supposed to defeat and they are set up so that they are clearly a villain and obstacle that you, as the hero, need to get rid of. In this game, the 'boss fights' are monsters just doing their jobs, leading their lives, and often times have nobler motivations than you as the main character.   This leads to surprising levels of introspection and thoughtfulness, and at least for me, formed a desire to replay the game from the start to try to do things differently a second time around.",1,0

I highly suggest this game, and give it the support it deserves and still hoping for a Dust 2 if possible. I beat the game and I am satisfied, The Ending is a little open so I do not know if there will be a sequel, but If there was I would not complain and buy that one as well, just based on the performance of this game. I would say it is worth the $15, no doubt. It also makes the game 100% more enjoyable if you have a controller for this game, I would say it was meant for the controller, as it once was on Xbox, so yea it will be worth the price of the game and the price of the controller you buy to play this magnificent title.

5082771,391220,Rise of the Tomb Raider,"Lara's back, she's a badass, and she doesn't want your cis white male bull ♥♥♥♥.  Positives: - Lara and her voice actress (though other characters are pretty good too) - a good story, though, in my opinion, a bit below the previous game's level - lots of action packed scenes, and less QTEs - the game is ultra atmospheric, the sound, lighting, and sceneries make a really enjoyable adventure - the graphics are just simply amazing, along with the animations (especially the faces) - enjoyable combat and movement mechanics, not too complex, so it doesn't take a lot of time to get used to - quick loading times - beautiful, well constructed, and fun to explore tombs  Negatives: - hopefully my HIV test - the gun sounds are really sub-par, they don't feel powerful, which is kind of anticlimatic - some people complain that the game doesn't run well on their machine  I'm running the game on a desktop PC with the following specs: i7 3770k @ 4.20 GHz (memelord, I know) 16 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM @ 1600 MHz 250 GB SSD for Windows 7 2 TB HDD which the game runs from MSI GTX 980 4GB (not Ti) at the factory clock speed ATI Radeon HD 4850 1GB for my secondary monitor 2x 60Hz 1920x1080p monitor  With this setup, and everything maxed in graphics, except the 2 blur options and film grain, in borderless fullscreen mode, I usually get around 75-80 FPS with SMAA, and around 60-65 with SSAA 2x, though I don't recommend maxing everything out because the blizzards lower my FPS by 10.  I definitely recommend this game if you have a decent enough PC to run it on, I often catch myself in awe, stopping to look around , taking screenshots for wallpapers, the sights and atmosphere are just that good, otherwise, running it on low/medium is good enough, the game still looks nice, and you won't be too disappointed with the core of the game either.  9/10, so far GOTY material for me.",1,1

3770518,300060,ADR1FT,"'Houston we have a problem, we are Adr1ft!'  In this instance, it is the series of life threatening problems you endure after what we can only assume is a major asteroid hit.   I for one love detailed space based games, that truely give you the feel of being weightless in spaceeeeeeeeeeeee! 'cough' sorry I could not resist, back on subject.   The environment, movemnt in space, the constant concern about your oxygen levels (which is also used for propulsion as well as that thing called breathing), the earth (which is amazing looking down at it both day and night) and the ginormous space station.   Everything is even more breathtaking on ultra in 4K! Hold on need more oxygen (insert inhaling of oxygen sounds here)...ahhh, better!   Now I might add you feel a bit like a Fabergé egg adr1ft in space, but lets be honest you kinda should. I mean space suits are not suits of armor like that of a Mediæval Knight persay. Yes they keep oxygen in (important) and diffrent kinds of radiation out (also important) but, the suit is easy to damage in game because it's not a Knights suit of armor as it's an EVA like suit. Luckily for you, it can be fixed when you manage to come across a repair staion.   Gameplay is smoth, I have had no game related issues, I have seen some others have had 'issuse' but what new game dose not these days? The important thing is that the game devs fix said problems and as of right now I can't say there's anything minor nor game breaking.  So if you love space, richly detailed environments, resource management of Oxygen  ( hmm, wonder how many times I have used the word oxygen in this review) and problem solving, then you too should love this game!  Well more of space station disaster sim.   I rate it 5 out of 5 Andromeda's Now you have to ask your self, am I referring to Andromeda the Star, the Person, or the Ship? =)",1,0

There are some mods for FTL, most notably (for me anyways) is the captain's edition mod, which adds many new encounters, weapons, and visual effects to the game.

3476774,284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"In Pixel Puzzles: Japan you need to solve a selection of 19 puzzles with different scenarios, difficulties and pictures. The concept is quite easy, you have pieces and you need to put them all together. The difference is, these pieces (who are also not your typical ones, with different shapes and sizes) are not static and they are always moving up and down and from left to right in some sort of koi pond.   There is no timer for you to solve these puzzles and there are no tricks so take your time and have a bit of relaxing time if you have been playing something story heavy or you just want to escape from the usual violence on shooting in other games.   The pictures are inspired by the Japanese culture so expect a lot of pink from the cherry bosom trees or some old statues and buildings. It took me around 12 hours to finish all these puzzles and it was a great choice to play between other games. As the levels progress so do you. You are a young disciple Monk, and as you advance in harder puzzles you will improve as well until you attain your “enlightenment”.    While the moving pieces was an interesting idea it may become a bit frustrating on the final puzzles. Some pieces become smaller and the number of them will increase so it means more pieces will be moving. If you want to click and drag a specific piece you saw this may prove to be harder considering there are so many moving and the mouse pointer did not feel so accurate at times. Just like when doing a normal puzzle, I always start with the surrounding frame and then move to one of the corners and keep going from there. Some puzzles can take more time than others and I struggled with one that had too many similar colors in all places which brings another flaw: there is no save or pause option. If you want to start a new level you may as well finish it, otherwise you will need to restart all over This is not an issue on most of the puzzles but if a puzzle is taking you longer than expected or you need to leave your PC, having an option to not start all over again would be a good thing to have.  In the end this was a nice little time sink. The music is simple but relaxing enough but after a couple of hours I decided to put my own playlist of Zen/Meditation music and the results were much better. I felt relaxed and the game does exactly what you should expect.",1,0

5111285,391540,Undertale,"*Spoiler Free*  Let me start by saying that I have never written a review for a steam game before, simply because I found that if a game I liked was good enough, people would already know, and so my input was not needed.  But this, THIS game has resonated with me so much that I am compelled to let people know what an amazing experience that was delivered in but a ten dollar steam game.  Undertale will take you on adventure like never before, and it will do it in a way that I had never before experienced in a game. It takes the elements of standard RPGs, and then takes them in a whole other direction. The unique mechanics presented in EVERY FIGHT keeps the game from becoming stale from a gameplay standpoint. On top of this, players have several options when it comes to how they will finish a fight. Should I slay my foes mercilessly, or do I allow them to live and show some compassion? Every time this decision comes up, it drastically changes the way the rest of the game is played.  Although it is a rather short game, Undertale's story is drenched with lovable characters, comedy, and emotion. In such a short time, I found that not only did I care about the characters I was interacting with, I cared about the person I was playing as well; I was special....  As stated previously, decisions you make in your playstyle affect large parts of the game, all of which add to the replay value. This EVEN pertains to your decision to RESET THE GAME, as decisions made in a previous playthrough can still affect dialogues that happen in the current one. The attention to detail is astounding.  Having said all of this, all of my opinions come from the game as a story, an experience. I would spend my money on this game for the story alone, not to mention the classic retro style RPG feel, the excellent soundtrack, the unique and fair but challenging style of fights, and everything else this game has to offer. From someone who has never ever ever reccomended another game on here, you owe it to yourselves to get this game.",1,1
4520150,346900,AdVenture Capitalist,"AdVenture Capitalist is yet one more entry into the overcrowded click/idle game genre; still it manages to stand out from the others due to being a satire of its whole category.  Pros:  -decent art style  -heavy sense of humour  -funny references  -having to decide what to buy/upgrade next and when to restart gives you some sense of control  -achievements give a purpose to keep playing  -fair free to play model  Cons:  -offers nothing really new  -due to its genre,there's not much of a 'game' here  Overall AdVenture gives us no real innovations per se,and if you're bored of the genre or simply don't like it then this won't change your mind. But its sense of humour,its nagging critique of what's wrong with this genre and the fact it doesn't take itself seriously gives it a good edge over the competition...after all I still find myself checking into it regularly to unlock all the achievements.

1663652,226560,Escape Dead Island,"Look, I rarely give a bad review. It's not that I didn't enjoy the game itself, but the many things that were wrong with this game. Escape Dead Island is a Third-Person open-world?, mystery?, Hack 'n Slash? I really don't know. It has nice cel-shaded visuals and all, but this game was drowning in flaws which sorta ruined the experience for me. It has a boring, confusing story. Crappy combat. A bad camera. Annoying controls. Awful voice acting. Framerate issues. Shallow and limited (supposedly) open-world areas. Useless in-game features (eg. Camera for 'supposedly grabbing' intel). Irritating NPC's. And a crap-load of unused potential. This game isn't at all Dead Island, and although it didn't take anything away from me, it may to others. If you get this game on sale for $3 then it's okay, but I wouldn't recommend anyone get out of their way to play this. I personally didn't hate the game. It wasn't awful. It was just all the issues it had that took away from the experience. Unfortunately I can't give this game any higher than 4/10",-1,1

5905893,50620,Darksiders,"It is actually quite difficult to find substantial critiques of this game. Some of the ports are clunky but most are easily fixed if you take the time to reassign keys in a logical way. The game is very linear so you sacrifice some autonomy to get a very interesting and unique story. The combat is very entertaining and the various kills leave nothing to the imagination. At times, however, it did feel like you were just mashing buttons and everything around you would die eventually in the end. Also, it was very annoying having dash and block as the same key. Sometimes you would dash right into an enemy attack.  The playthrough with all the various gadgets, weapons, and mystical items brings a great amount of entertainment. I believe the true value lies within the story though. I found myself wanting to beat the next area and boss just to get to the next cutscenes. This may just be me as I appreciate it when companies put thought not only in the combat, but the reasons for why you're fighting all these baddies and spilling thousands of gallons of blood. Although I did not find darksiders to be the most difficult game as I never died through my first playthrough on normal, the game has a lot to offer that will make you want to play it again. Very much looking forward to playing Darksiders 2.",1,0

To play Devil's advocate, the naval combat is excellent, land battles are believable and enjoyable, research and population are managed better than previous titles and the overall feel is less clunky than its predecessors.   The AI remains a schizophrenic insane diplomat in the strategic map, and goes from Napoleon's protege to lobotomised monkey depending on the alignment of the planets, and often carelessly runs its cavalry into stakes or gun lines.

141757,105600,Terraria,"There is not much to say about this game. Well for a start, normally I find a game I like and find issues realated to the game. I enjoy this game so much and I stuggle to find related issues. I mean yeah the graphics are good for the game itself and the amount of gameplay which you go into in order to complete the game is just intense. I haven't even won yet. This is a game that I feel is best played with a group of friends on a private server, servers for this game are really simple and easy to set up and play. Whether it is just a LAN server with a brother or sister or even a server where you play with a group of your friends from across the country. Terraria is a really great game which will definately create many hours of enjoyment.   I am struggling to find some nagative issues with the game but If I was to find one, it would have to be the fact that in order to complete some things in the game you need to create special items such as a disposable item to summon or a weapon you need to kill a boss. Some of these weapons will take far too long to create simply because the drop for find chance for the ingreediants are far too remote. This is a problem for me becuase I spend far to long gatherting them and I feel that It can just be a waste of time.

It plays out on a grid where you move your party around, position them, and attack. Skills can be combined for greater effect, which adds some tactical elements with conserving AP to ensure such combos can be performed. There's nothing really special about the combat.

At the start of the game, he promises that you will stop caring for your people, that wishfulness will turn to disapointment and no matter how much you think you will not stoop to such things, eventually, if you choose to fully complete the game and its achievements, you will realize that he is right. Never has a game influenced me phychologically and mentally on such a level. If you go into this game expecting satisfaction upon completion and joy upon victory, you will not find it here but you will find something more sophisticated.",1,1
5696012,461820,Legionwood: Tale of the Two Swords,"  Short: Give it a try if you like old style JRPG / RPG Maker-esque games and don't mind them when they are a bit more difficult. From my perspective this game is nice, the story is interesting, characters seem to develop and mechanics are ok. Text and writing so far have been good, I didn't spot any glaring spelling mistakes and everything made sense. Art is fitting and does not detract from the game. Audio works but is not its strongest point. The game explains most mechanics and introduces them nicely. Save often and keep the flexible AP system and the ability to train anyone any 'TECH' (skill) in mind if you get stuck.   The game warned me of an area, I still wandered around and died... I am not sure what I expected to happen. :D   On the box it says:    6 playable characters with unlimited customisation options. (So far I got 4, yes to the customisation)    30+ locations to explore. (not sure how they are counted but so far there has been enough to see and explore)    Sweeping fantasy storyline full of twists and turns. (Just yes, I want to see where it ends)    Hand drawn art. (Some of them are quite charming)    Completely free to play. (YES)   So far everything seems to be true. :)   SPOILERISH Gameplay tricks/hints:    There are a couple of things I would like to point out that might help to avoid frustration:    The game gets sometimes quite difficult especially due to only allowing to save at certain save crystals, checkpoints, on the world map and after sleeping, make sure to use every opportunity you get to save as you never know what happens next.    There is no shame in backtracking or leaving an area briefly just to save or pickup new items before continuing.     Try to keep enouch money at hand to revive a character at your local chapter, just in case.     Running away from monsters is an option, as there seems to be no penalty for trying and it saved me a couple of times until I reached a point where I could heal up again.    Elements are important and using enemies' weaknesses is a big plus.    Evasion and accuracy are your friend.    Healing spells can be used out of combat, make sure everyone learns them.    Make frequent use of the AP System as you can ALWAYS just redistribute the points if you want to build a character differently.    Weapons give special abilities like higher initiative for attacks and deal different damage types, if your weapons are not effective switch for a different one and see if it works better. I avoided two handed because I prefer the evasion bonus on shields.    Grinding is an option and fairly save around or close to healing/save crystals.    Block and consumables can help with tougher fights as a last resort as some are quite rare      This is the first time that a negative review actually made me play a game so I could see for myself.",1,1

3212655,269270,LOVE,"LOVE is a fun little platformer game with easy and tight controls. You have your movement keys, jump and the ability to set a respawn point - now get to the end.   There are 12 levels in the main game + 10 extra ones that aren't in the main exe for some reason. It can be beaten easily in 30 minutes if you take your time and speedruns usually take 10 minutes. The fun I found in LOVE was the race to get a better score and speedrun it as fast as possible, coupled with some hidden achievements and Its a party. There's a one life only mode for the truly badass people out there - also fun to play with friends and see who can get the furthest.  For such a small game, I wouldn't expect the soundtrack to be so diverse but surprisingly Its quite listenable and I wouldn't mind having it in my library of game soundtracks. Calm, smooth and complimenting the 8bit art style.  Although unnecessary, I'd still love the see the ability to rebind keys and steam workshop support for custom levels would really be the icing on the cake. As it stands, you can get bored of the initial 12 levels pretty quickly.  If you're looking to try a simple obstacle course platformer, not too difficult but certainly not easy, give it a try. If you're looking for something hardcore, reminiscent of 'I Wanna Be The Guy', maybe look elsewhere but try LOVE just the same - in YOLO mode, tell me how that works out for you.",1,0

When you die, you start all over. Standard roguelike shooter style, save for going down vs going across a screen or going up like a Shmup game.   unlocking other color palettes and styles is amusing and reminds me of the kind of thing you find in Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne. I'd say that here it's a little more bite-sized though. It almost feels like a classic gameboy game that's running ultra smooth (which it does have a GB color palette to unlock)  I think my only gripe is that I've yet to get past the third or fourth level. I enjoy the game, but I can't say I'm that great at it. But it's still fun none the less and I enjoy trying to git-gud anyway. Worth your time and a couple bucks, totally worth it on sale.",1,0

221482,108710,Alan Wake,"Alan Wake is a superb survival horror game developed by Remedy - the team who made the first two episodes of Max Payne.  You play as Alan who's lost his wife under mysterious circumstances - he needs to find out why and how she disappeared and ultimately - of course - save her.  I would not call the plot very original, however, there are some twists and also the game feels like a TV show. There are several chapters and when you start the next one you hear narration and the good old 'previously on...' sentence that really makes you feel as if you were playing an interactive TV show.  The gameplay is interesting, too: Alan has an array of weapons such as pistol and shotgun but none of these work until he uses his flashlight to remove the 'shadow' from his enemies. Only after that can he actually wound the bad guys with these conventional weapons. Ammo is limited and the developers hid several caches throughout the game so it is recommended that you find these. There are other collectibles, of course, just to increase the number of achievements you can attain.  Alan Wake is a beautiful game - lighting and the shadows are portrayed realistically and as both are important to the story the developers could not go wrong with them. And they didn't. Voice acting and the music score are also top notch.  Too bad the game has too very short DLCs (Signal and Writer) and it has an expansion pack, too, which gives the game some arcade-like features that were completely unnecessary.  Overall, I found Alan Wake a unique third person shooter and I can only recommend it to anybody who loves the genre.",1,0

The first gun you get, (guns actually, sniper sucks dont use it) feels really good. The hit reg issue has been fixed and i think that in general this game really brought itself back from the grave.  Think of it as a clone between cs go and COD. You can aim down sights and sprint, but in general its a lot slower than most modern millitary shooters. You have to know how to work angles and when to take it slow and look down long sight lines with your rifle.  All in all, its a really good game. And its free.

3036895,262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"First and most importantly I find this game fun. The game has a shallow learning curve and the FBTHF (From Boot To Have Fun) ratio is about as low as any game since Doom &amp; Doom2.  Now, one thing you will immediately notice is that your heroes have flaws. Yes, thats right, not the super hero movie kind of flaws that are 'cool to have flaws' ('I'm not a hero, I kill people' or 'I'm too perfect for my own good'); no your heroes have real flaws like being a cheat, petty thief, or having a 'holier than thou' attitude. These quirks manifest themselves in game by preventing you from easily managing stress levels and lowering combat attributes among other things. This is part of the game. Its what makes the game fun. If you are looking for perfect heroes who just need a healing potion and then off to the next adventure you probably don't want this game.  In my opinion the game is well crafted with bonuses like cool narration and a well done Gothic art style to boot.   Also, the game makes me believe that Red Hook, the organization behind this game, realizes that people are going to be imperfect and yet they can still offer great value. Perhaps this game should be used by management students and/or in onboarding processes to prepare management for the complexities of real world personalities -- or maybe they can just play it as a stress relief activity :-D .

3572757,289650,Assassin's Creed Unity,"-THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THE GAME WAS ON RELEASE AS SEVERAL PATCHES HAVE COME OUT THE FIX LOTS OF ISSUES THE GAME HAD TO START WITH-  So far I really enjoy this game. The multiplayer bits are extremely fun when played with a full group. Some of the controls are a bit different from the previous games and you really need to get used to those before expecting to be great at this game. Free running takes a bit more effort as it's been divided into a free run up and free run down catagory by pressing spacebar and E respectively. The graphics are really good when you have the hardware to support them, the recent patches by Ubisoft have cleared up most of the glitches and frame lags that have been present in the earlier editions, I haven't stuttered once in the time I've played it.  The Companion app which you need to open blue chests really isn't a huge deterrent from the real game, it's very similar to Kenway's fleet and other minigames of that sort in the other AC games and if you have windows 8 you can use the app for free or put it on your smartphone. As for people complaining about microtransactions in the game, there are relatively few. You can unlock things quicker by paying for 'Helix Credits' but the only things unlockable soley through Helix Credits are timesaver packs which are wholly unnecessary. Skills must be purchased with sync points which aren't extremely difficult to earn and I feel like it adds a new angle to the game as you have to prioritize your skills and aren't immediately thrown into the game knowing everything. TL;DR This is a really good game, it takes some getting used to and if you have a low grade system you probably won't be able to run it extremely well but if you have the hardware to support this game and the patience to learn the intricacies of it, it's certainly worth picking up (Especially on sale).",1,1

Like The ability to set the story line, Blood and gore, Bad language and sexual content bars. It also allows you to pick the box design that your game is going to be shipped in. The gameplay is pretty good. eventhough the sprite player doesn't move. It allows you to pick what you spend more time on. Graphics, sound ect. The reviews let you know what you could of improved on. When you game is off the market your fans tell you what they liked and disliked about it. EYA rateing 7/10",1,0

2816246,252570,Depths of Fear :: Knossos,"I recommend this game only because it's super cheap and feel it has potential.  The screenshots look pretty cool, and the idea of randomly generated levels is great.  Here are my complaints: -Half the textures look pixelated for some reason. It look like some textures are rendered with at least bilenar filtering so they look fine. Then some textures are rendered with linear filtering, making it look like I'm playing Doom or something. I'm playing on the highest setting. Not even sure how this mistake is in the game. As a graphics programmer, I know just how easy it is to change the filtering method on a texture. Hopefully this is changed soon, or maybe I have some kind of issue on my machine.  - I am fairly confused what my objectives are and what I'm doing. I wandered around in that stadium for a while until I entered some kind of dungeon. I then wander around the dungeon and try to get to the next level, but I can't seem to defeat some of the main monsters like the satyr. I read somewhere ahead of time that you can't defeat them until later floors or something, but this should probably be made more clear in game somehow.   -The character models are OK for an indie title. The animations though, could really use some work. You can see your feet in first person, and the animations on those look kinda strange. Also the toes don't look quite anatomically correct, but it's cool that he tried I guess. I've had my character's running animations playing at odd times when I wasn't even moving. Like when I was hiding in those hideable closet areas, my movement was completely disabled, but the movement animations would still play. Also I landed on the ground once after a jump and my running animations kept playing. You may want to look into animation trees or something. And as for the monsters and their walking animations, it's fairly doable to properly match up their walking frames with their movement speed to make them not look like they're ice skating. Watch some tutorials, maybe try root motion, and speeding up or slowing down the animation depending on movement speed.  -The music doesn't really fit. One song literally sounded like music from Terminator during the car chace scene and the pipe bombs being thrown. I wouldn't necessarily say to go with a classical theme or anything like that, but somehow the 80's synth just feels really jarring and off.  -I got in a few fights with monsters. All you really do is kindof click a little and your character swings the weapon and kills the monster. I got down to level 3 where things changed into more of a marble looking theme, and it looks like I ran into the main badguy with his red eyes. He was walking in a small circle at first, instead of patrolling the level. I started fighting him and was kindof disappointed with the combat. Basically he swings his giant axe, but I also swing my spiked club. As I swing, it seems to interrupt his attack animation all of a sudden and I guess he doesn't hit me, but there's no pain sound or pain animation from him or anything so I can barely tell what's going on. I swung at him for a while but didn't seem to kill him or anything. It was about then that I stopped playing.  -I see a lot of shadow mapping shimmering artifacts. Also the edges of shadows aren't smooth, but very pixelated. There are ways to fix that and make them look better. Lighting overall looks kindof cool.  I myself am trying to make a roguelike first person shooter so I'm looking for other games for ideas, and to fill the void until I make the game I want to play as well.",1,0

4860318,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Believe it or not, this is the second Souls game that I've played (Bloodbourne was my first but we can debate about that some other time). I tried DS2 but the port for the controller was horrible. I thought this was going to have a horrible port too but I was wrong; I was able to play as if I was playing in a console except with better FPS (as long as you have the specs). This game has gained a lot of patches and balancing updates since release, so I can safely say that you won't find much bugs and OP weapons anymore. FromSoftware keeps this game updated, and remember that the first DLC is going to come up some time this Fall.   I've finished the game three time using three different builds. In other words, this game has a LOT of replayability factor because of one main reason: the variety of builds you can use. Once you get bored of PVE, there's always PVP. You will meet a lot of folks wether they be nice or not, it's all fun.  The soundtracks are amazing. All boss fights will be etched to your mind by their signature soundtracks. Just starting from the main menu alone, you know you'll have eargasms all throughout a playthrough.  For the story, I missed out on a lot of hype regarding the lore when I finished this game. It seems you really need to finish DS1 if you want to have a greater feeling of attachment towards the story, but other than that you'll be able to play the game and still understasnd it just fine.  9/10 overall because the gameplay, story, and sountracks are superb, but the DLCs haven't arrived yet. I'm sure this will be a 10/10 once they do.  Update: Well the first DLC has come (Ashes of Ariandel) so I figured I should update this. The DLC was absolutely breathtaking, albeit short. I'm not gonna spoil you or anything, but I should probably mention that you need the Lord of Londor ending if you want to get more interesting dialogues in the DLC. It's not that important but at least it shines a little bit of light about the characters.  Here's my updated numeric rating on the game:  Gameplay mechanics: 8/10 because poise isn't exactly back but everything else feels so smooth  OSTs: 10/10  Story: 10/10 if you really delve into the lore and read up  Content: 9/10 because the dlc was too short but it gave really cool new spells and weapons  Overall: 9.3/10",1,0
1015414,214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"I really...really...really want to recommend this game. It's got a great musical score, great artistic style, humor, interesting and seldom-seen-in-a-video-game Mexican-theme. And I've always loved Metroid style games.   ** BUT **  The platforming sections of the game are ridiculously difficult. Needlessly difficult, I'd add. I'm still stuck on the section in the Tuli Tree, where you must do a series of wall jumps combined with flipping in and out of the land of death. I cannot do it. And I'm no stranger to platformers!  I wouldn't have a problem with this kind of difficulty if it were only used sparingly in areas of the map with hidden power ups or bonus content. But to make just getting to the next dungeon/temple/castle/level this ludicrously challenging is too much to ask! I play games to be entertained; if the gameplay turns into a repetitive series of failures that's no fun at all!  Part of the problem is that the controller layout isn't ideal. A few glaring control issues: One, Right-Trigger to switch between light and dark worlds!? Bad button mapping! Also, when playing two players, we often accidentally enter the bubble mode, which is disaterous if we both do it at once! And the button placement for 'chicken mode' isn't so good either. Rather than doding (left trigger) I sometimes bump the left button for Chicken mode. And on top of all that, there's no way to re-map the buttons.  So, DEV... before I could recommend this game to anyone, PLEASE fix the level designs and button mapping!   EDIT: I changed my mind on this one. I gave it rest for a while then came back to it. As I had previously said, it IS insanely hard! But I did finally manage to make more progress. I'm now all the way to boss fight with Calaca! It's definitely a good game, although, I still wish they had made a easy mode!",1,0

3324077,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I have put roughly 70 hours into this game and it is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it and without further ado here is my analysis:  Pros: 1.) Unique idea. The asymetrical multiplayer is not used enough. Playing as the monster I feel empowered and like a badass! As a hunter with a team that communicates I feel like a real team player! 2.) Balance. The game wasn't always balanced but it is now and I would like to dissuade your fears of that. The Wraith was originally OP but mostly that was because of some oversight with her manueverability. 3.) Teamwork/Survival. I love playing as the monster the most because I really enjoy evading the hunters and then laying the smackdown on them. However I also play as the hunters because it is just so much fun. Usually I hat competitive multiplayer because everyone is so angry and hostile if you aren't the best of the best, but here it isn't that way because everyone has to work together or it's everyone's fault not just your's! 4.) Diversity. Every character is unique and feels great. Every monster plays differently and every Hunter plays differently.  5.) Weekend challenges. Challenges that the community takes on together to unlock skins and whatnot.  Cons: 1.) DLC. When the new hunters and Monster came out they were not even slightly balanced (Hunters OP, Monster UP). Also all of the skins and what not are way too over priced. There is no reason for that much money having to be shelled out for simple skins. 2.) DLC Balance. Whenever new hunters/monsters are thrown into the mix everything gets thrown off tilt. It wasn't even slightly fun to play as any monster when you had the new hunters going against you. You always lost. ALWAYS! 3.) Started Game MM. I hate joining a game that is already in session but hey just wait it out you'll get to pick next round.  All in all I really enjoy this game and can't wait to see the next monster. I hope it is something that offers a whole new playstyle. I highly recommend this game to everyone and hope you enjoy it yourself.  Happy hunting :)",1,0

5362222,41070,Serious Sam 3: BFE,"I love all the Serious Sam games to date, I used to play them as a child and really enjoyed them, thats why I have a lot of confronted feelings about this game, so here it goes:  ++PROS++ -Mindlessly killing hordes of monsters is always fun -Not serious game/dialogue, funny one-liners  --CONS-- -It gets TOO repetitive. Dont get me wrong, killing hordes of enemies is fun... but there is a point, where you are in a zone and enemies keep respawning, and killing them stops being fun an becomes a chore. Near the end of the game there is a section where you have to kill around 3000 enemies of all kinds, which takes you like an hour, all in the same place.  -The enviroments: It tried too hard to have 'realistic' maps, I mean, with a lot of detailed textures and real-world looking. In my opinion Serious Sam does good with less 'serious' textures (which, by the way, dont look that good) and a more cartoony look. Half of the game seems to take place in the same city map and the other half in the same desert map.  -The enemies: 85% of the enemies are the same from older games. This isnt a bad thing of course, but the new enemies they added are completely unoriginal and not fun to fight against. Alien soldiers that have human guns and just stand there shooting at you, also, they dont have projectiles you can dodge, but hitscan, which means that you cant dodge their shots. Wellp, imo that goes a bit against what serious sam is supposed to be.  I had some fun with the game and enjoyed it at the beginning, but it got repetitive real quick and finishing it was kind of boring. Wouldnt recommend this game for full price.",-1,1

3926336,306760,Obduction,This game full stands up to the description 'spiritual successor to Myst.' I am enthralled with the environment and the puzzles. If I were to give any negative criticisms at all it would be that the puzzles tend to be a little too easy and involve copious amounts of travelling.  I hope Obduction serves as the start of a new beginning for Cyan. Really hope to see more games of this type coming out of a studio that can do the genre justice.,1,0
3326403,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I'm a big fan of asymmetric multiplayer, and Evolve does a great job. The parts of the match where you're tracking down the monster can be a bit tedious, but they do have a certain slow-burn tension that I appreciate, and the fights are intense. Still hoping for more people to get into it, it's unfortunate that the games that have tried to change the standard multiplayer FPS formula like Evolve and Titanfall never got the player support they deserved. I'd rather play this over another CoD any day",1,0

2117785,238260,Pinball Arcade,"Don't mind my hours because I've played a ton of Pinball Arcade. I first fell in love with it on the Playstation 3 and eventually moved to the Steam version, which I like much more. I highly recommend getting the season packages. In fact, this is put out by a fairly small outfit with a lot of dedication and passion for pinball, so I pay extra for the pro pack to help support them. I don't even mess with the extra stuff that comes with the pro, except maybe ball skins. They're just worth it.  If you don't know, buying a past season gives you all the games from that season, since they've already released. Your game (Pinball Arcade) updates a few minutes after your purchase, so there isn't an install, unless things have changed since I bought one last. If you buy the current season, there may only be a few games but be patient. Similar to a current season of TV episodes, the games are still being released and you'll get them as they come until the purchased season is over. It gives you something to look forward to!  As an 80s kid, I didn't have money for plunking into pinball or arcade machines. I was one of those who would stand around and watch others play, just to feel the excitement. My father worked in a factory and would sometimes bring home an actual pinball that popped out of a big machine on occasion. I settled for rolling that around on the floor (sad, I know!)  But now, I have more than I could ever dream at my fingertips! And they're so realistic! Farsight takes the actual tables and dissects them, ensuring we get as authentic an experience as possible besides playing the real thing. And while owning real pinball machines sounds great, think of the upkeep and expense, not to mention the room you'd need. It's a romantic thought, but this is way better.  I have a number of pinball video games, but there are two that rule supreme for me: Pinball FX2 (Zen) and Pinball Arcade. I love Zen Pinball for the fantasy angle. They make excellent tables that never existed so anything is possible, especially with Marvel and Star Wars! But when I want to play something that was actually crafted and made the rounds back when I was wishing I could play, that's when Pinball Arcade comes through for me.  I play using a Logitech Gamepad F310, by the way, and it works great!  This is my first time actually sitting down and writing a review here (I think), so I hope it was worth a poop.",1,1

4298543,33100,Alien Shooter,"Alien Shooter does not get cute with its title. You shoot aliens, and lots of them. With the complexity of a well-made flash game, there is really not to this title. You shoot aliens to get cash. You use that cash to buy new weapons and ammo. Sometimes the aliens are yellow, sometimes they are blue, but most of the time they are green. You can choose to set the blood color to red or green, and even password protect so the blood can't be changed back to red. I guess we all have to think of the children.  There is an isometric top down view to this game. Move around with WASD, and aim with the mouse. Most of your time is spent dancing around to avoid enemies while holding down on the left mouse button to fire. I felt the aim was not always as tight as I'd like it, but at least your character can pull off some pretty fancy footwork. I don't see a lot of options for customization in this game, so you have the choice between 9 or so different weapons, and a flashlight.  The music can pump you up sometimes, really picking up when you're fighting a large horde. The graphics are very representative of a free flash game, and yet this is not a free flash game.  If you are in the mood for a mindless shooter, I guess this can be ok if you find it on sale for very cheap. I don't think there is anything here that isn't improved upon in free games. If you are looking to spend some cash, I'd look elsewhere first.  Grade: D",-1,0

I accidentally whack-a-moled my whole team like three times before I realized the aoe was so powerful.   The only real issue I have is that the heavy flamer was kept out of multiplayer, which sucks because it is my favorite weapon in single player and is awesome to use. Apparently it was left out for balance and/or performance issues, which is bs. Never understood why games are so afraid of flamethrowers. Also, sometimes the combat can get a little monotonous on lower difficulties where the genestealers seem to rush single file at you.   I don't understand the performance issues people are having because it runs smooothly for me.

4403013,338190,Just Get Through,"'Roguelite' platformer with simple combat mechanics.  Disclaimer: this review is from someone who is not very goot at platformers.  Pros: *Various modes; *Responsive; *Procedurelly generated levels forces to adapt; *Traps require serious effort to time everything right; *Leaderboards are a cool feature; *Level creator; *That visual awards for reaching LVL50 is trivial, but pleasing; *Visuals are minimalist and functional.  Cons: *Classic mode can draw for over 1 hour. For me it is too long, I hate playing the first 20 levels over and over again, just to reach more interesting levels (45+). It is just such a joy killer. I understand that the 'save current game' function would be abused, but there are other ways to solve this problem. For example, unlockable difficulty slider or the ability to skip levels. This is the main reason I stopped playing. Yes 'hardcore' mode is challenging, but it's not my cup of tea. *Lacks 'Race mode'. But no big deal.  Tl; dr: it is worth the price (I paid 1,2 (or so) Euros). But I didn't expect to burn out so fast. 9/10 color palettes. ",1,0

544281,203160,Tomb Raider,"6 out of 10  Take Lara out for a spin on her first adventure. From a time before she became a famous archeologist.  This is an adaptation of a console game. Therein lies what bothers me. It may actually be a very good console game but not a good PC game. To be fair this is not the worst game I have ever played. In fact the second half is quite good. This justifies the thumbs-up. Just a pity the first half is so terrible. I would say that this game is not for serious gamers. It may be very acceptable for a pickup every now and then.  Tomb Raider should be all about exploring, searching for loot, solving puzzles and fantastic locations. Although the game has some of that its more about the action.   The good:  1. Mmmm.. nothing really stands out.  2. There are some nice locations but way too little. Most of the scenery is very standard.  3. Some cool loot. Unfortunately most loot is pointless other than for the achievement.  4. The second half action is quite good.   The bad:  5. Adapted form console, the camera does not flow freely.  6. Very linear game play. Although you have to go back to the few locations to get all the collectibles because you don't have the gear required yet. Very irritating.  7. The game looks good mostly, however Lara and other characters looks like a wax dolls. Skin tone and textures are console like.  8. Why is there a crouch button? It does not work. Lara crouches when she feels it is necessary.  9. Lara keeps on lighting a torch and switching to the pistol. I had to reselect my weapon the whole time.   The Ugly:  10. Some of the most pointless cut-scenes I have ever seen.  11. Be warned some of the death scenes are way too gross. Not for me. There are also heaps and heaps of blood and corpses; amazing number of corpses for a remote island.  12. Awful button pressing sequence scenes. This may work on console but not on PC.",1,0

Neptune for example, you can see her as adorable or you can hate her for being so annoying and meme-like. I choose the former (owo)b I won't write a so deep review so in my opinion we have:   Pros  - Charismatic characters with different stereotypes for every taste - A long but good enough story told as a visual novel - Turn based combat that takes in account your position on the battlefield - Panties (don't deny you love them) - Many different outfits and accessories to choose for them to wear - Many unlockables by gathering resources - Nice music even though it can be repetitive later on - The ability to change the game via the remake system, spawning different enemies and resources - You can adjust the difficulty via this remake system but it has no gain or loss - Appart of your weapon and clothes you can equip chips that increase (and most times also decrease) your stats when you go HDD letting you customize even further your battle style - Noire &lt;3 (or each of your favorites) - Different endings according to chars unlocked and... well, you better discover by yourself. - You'll need at least 3 playthroughs to get enough MB to unlock everything - The colosseum let's you play different challenges even if still the same kind of combat - And of course, lolis &lt;3 You can go HDD if you prefer bigger breasts though   Cons  - The combat can end up being repetitive - You can just use 3 chars at once even if there are 4 main ones - It can take too long to complete everything (I'm not done yet at almost 250 current hours). That can be a pro if you want a long game - At first it's unavoidable but later is so easy to miss events or places that you should go to unlock certain dungeons that at the same time unlock others and have items that let you unlock items - If you don't like silly humor and/or highpitched voices you might hate a lot of this game - The variety of enemies is quite small. Most of them will have the same model with different colors to say they are a stronger version - Leveling takes so much grinding at first until you can beat certain monsters without being killed in the process - Making money is the same, hard at first and later you'll be swimming in money (except if you wanna buy some chips that cost millions each) - Once you've gone past certain level, even if you increase the difficulty, everything will be too easy - There are a few DLC colosseum fights that are ridiculously hard compared to the rest of the game  Overall it's good even with those flaws (^_^)y",1,0

1980082,234140,Mad Max,"  Let's just start off, it's another great game published by Warner Brothers.   The game definitely gives a 'Mad Max' feel and really matches the movies (from what I've seen) in my opinion. Fighting is great as ever. Pretty close (if not exactly the same) to Batman Arkham. When it comes to hand to hand combat, there isn't hordes of enemies to attack unlike Batman titles, but even with less targets it is still a interesting and exciting fight.   Car functionality is pretty good. A lot better than the Batmobile in Arkham Knight. Granted, they're both really different but at times I had issues driving the Batmobile. Even though it is great, it still doesn't compare any Need for Speed driving, but not bad at all.   Graphics are very nice in this game. I am running at 'max' settings and have no issues what so ever. Even tested on a lower grade machine and even on medium settings, it looks perfectly fine and runs solid as well.   Regarding story and the open-world aspect of the game. I would say that the story was very good, and really protrayed the sadness of this wasteland and kinda wanted to make me cry at times (perhaps I'm just a baby!). Not exactly sure where it falls into place with the original stories as for I've never watched them, but even from a view of knowing nothing about the story of Max, it made perfect sense and really left you the ablity to do whatever you want. Rather you want to wait on the main story and do side-missions or even other way around, it totally leaves the choice up to you. When you first begin, you think there is a lot of places to see in the small area you are currently at, but then you look at your map and see the miles of miles of endless driving to the very top of the map, you think otherwise! That feature made it even better, offering lots of areas to explore and left plenty of room for driving or taking down enemy vehciales. There are only about 6-8 different kind of side missions which are spread across the whole wasteland of Mad Max. While it kinda gets to be repetitive, it can still keep you interested. I however see that once your car is fuly upgraded, there will be no purpose to playing.      Quick recap!",1,1

2178796,239030,"Papers, Please","Good game? yes... Fun? Not for me. This is an interesting, challenging, and unique game... so why isn't it fun? It's as if the goal of the game is to leave you as frustrated as a real TSA or Border agent who's job sucks, family is scraping by and your work place rules are never consistant. The mechanics are tedious despite the game's simplicity.   Maybe that is supposed to be part of the challenge, but clicking and dragging and flipping through the rulebook frantically looking for that thing I know is wrong so that I can highlight it to begin the process of detaining, asking for papers, etc. takes much of that fun out for me. Especially when you know there is a descrepancy, but you waste time thumbing through things until you get to it just to use the game's rigid and unwaivering mechanic that allows you to move on.  Complaints aside, it is very interesting to see how how things pan out with your decisions made. Knowing you helped capture a murderer, or finding out later you let one through hit home in a weird subtle way. Having played it, i'd never recommend it at full price. I might at half price to a select few, but I think this one is going to fall into a small cult following. I",-1,0

3174184,267960,Hyper Fighters,"Blecch. I just played it again to be reminded why I didn't like it so here's my breakdown so you don't make the same mistake and try it twice like I did.  This game is supposed to be a nod to Afterburner, the massive arcade hit. In this game, you are in a plane of some sort - I don't know, I didn't pay attention to the story. This plane is extremely special in that it has nothing you would expect a modern plane to have. There is no radar, no speed control, and the control scheme is laughable. It REQUIRES you to use the mouse to aim and the arrow keys to move. Left click shoots, right click locks rockets and fires. Minimal voiceover, typos in the text, etc... One of the most unique features in the game is the magical water. I call it magical because somehow you can see the propellor on any boat you fly over but cannot see submarines until they surface to launch missiles at you. This brings me back to the radar, there isn't any. This means that there is no warning if a rocket is about to hit your ship. It just slams into you. If you're looking for a game to play with a younger child, this one might be good. Nothing looks real and they can 'fly' the ship while you shoot. MAYBE that would make it enjoyable. Otherwise, leave it in the street and hope some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ finds it first.",-1,0

The main part of that is the better classes are from the DLC's . The Baroness and Jack just mow throw enemies like its a cakewalk. Athena takes getting used to but can definitely hold her own once learning how to use her intially very short duration skill. Wilhelm is a nice tank until reaches endgame of first playthru then its very difficult to advance as his action skill and damage are just not enough to break through easily. Only other thing to mention is personally, the maps really are not appealing compared to BL2 because all have same Moon landscape, compared to variety of environments from BL2.

4294735,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"This is a bit of a difficult game for me to review. The big question is 'Did I like it?' And the answer is, yes and no. It brings very mixed feelings. I still checked Recommend but I've got caveats.  First of all the writing and acting and story are all good. There's one plot line that I don't think is all that great, but that's personal preference. I'm not really sold on some big mystic secret that is never mentioned by anyone in the books or show yet tons of people know about and just doesn't seem all that hard to find despite still being hidden.  And the other weakness of the story is how it fits in with the plot of the books and show. A few of the major characters do show up here, but they feel a bit odd surrounded by none of their supporting characters and instead being with a bunch of new people you've never seen before. Why is Danny with some new sellsword instead of Daario? Who's this Frostfinger guy with Jon basically filling in for Ser Alliser Thorne? And if Mira is so close to Margaery, why does she never show up in the show or books? It's a companion story, but it feels like there is a disconnect.  But other than that I thought the story was rather good. The problem is I'm not sure it works as a game. Especially as a Telltale game. The biggest problem with Telltale games is the lack of any real control. Yes you can make some choices which has some impact, particularly if certain characters live or not. But in the end it still just feels like you have no real power. And this story in particular repeatedly beats you over the head with your powerlessness and lack of choice. It's true to the source material in that, but it's not exactly fun to play, for me at least. And by making powerlessness a major theme it highlights the weakness of the Telltale formula. I enjoyed the hell out of Season 1 of The Walking Dead, and Season 2 is pretty good too if not quite as good as the first, and the Wolf Among Us is also great. But here I'm just not sure it works.  I did actually enjoy the story to an extent, but it also leaves a bad taste in my mouth. As a game it feels more like all this bad stuff is happening to me. Which isn't exactly fun to go through. Especially if there isn't a rewarding pay-off, which I don't feel there is. Maybe it's intended for a future season. If you're a fan of the book series and TV series and can enjoy being made to feel powerless, then I'd actually recommend this one as much as I've criticized it. Your mileage will vary.",1,0

3948760,308560,City Quest,"Okay, so far I'm only two hours (on record) in playing this game, on my first play through and have no idea how far into the game I am and just how much there is left to go. I saw this pop up on Steam, thought it looked quirky and interesting and decided to wait for a sale and when it happened I snapped it up. The only regret I have is in waiting so long, this game is worth it at full price.  This game may not be for everyone as it makes you think out of the box, I understand that the box these days is 'Here is a gun, go shoot things' but I'm talking about in adventure game terms.  Sure, there's quests to do which are pretty straight forward involving helping the homeless, pimp business and corrupt politicians. Your standard adventure game staples you might think. But you're some white dude with blonde hair who definitely has a disorder of some sort who can be talked into trying to disguise themselve as a Yakuza to aid the mafia.  If that paragraph didn't really make sense then the rest of the game will make less sense. If it did make sense to you then you're probably the protagonist of the game.  I may edit this after a few playthrough's, but somehow I think leaving this game in people's minds with a little morbid curiosity might fare better. If you've seen it and read about it and/or put it on your wishlist just do it. It's one of those games that you think you'll fire up for a few minutes to see what it's like, think 'everything is fairly standard and boring, nothings really happening. That's the first bit over, what's the fuss? I'll play a bit more and... what? Wait! What? Seriously? Is this?... Yes it is happening' and will just continue on.  If you want an adventure game that really makes use of you interacting with it for Steam achievements then this is for you.  If you want an adventure game that makes you try to find inventive ways for you to be killed then this is for you.  If you want an adventure game that tries to make you find ways to steal babies and then eat them then this is definitely for you, and you should probably seek help. ",1,1

1109348,218620,PAYDAY 2,"Honestly, when it comes to the Microtransactions and swarms of DLC, I can let that slide. I used to love this game, and I'd been hating the way it was heading for a long time. The MTs were just the cherry on the top of the cake.  Power-Creep DLC has unbalanced this game to the point where overkill are trying to change how the base game works to compensate for it.  Back when there was no death wish, we had a little skill we called 'Inspire'. It allowed any player to be revived at a chance instantly from any distance, just by shouting at them, which in 99% of cases allowed people to run off and do as they please, with no punishment for doing so. A teammate could get them back up and they'd be on their way. People had been crying for nerfs for eons, and they still are, really. But overkill did nothing about it.  Fastforward a little, and Overkill difficulty began to get stale for many people. It was too easy, they cried. Now, I'm not denying it wasn't too easy, even without inspire, and a new difficulty should have really been on the way. Overkill gladly gave us what we wanted, as we sat and lapped up the excruciating difficulty of what Death Wish used to be.  Of course, you had many people whining and complaining that it was too hard, sure. But did overkill tell them to get good? Nah, they instead released the Sniper Pack DLC, the first in a long line of powercreep DLC that made the game easier. Skulldozers too tough for you? Here's a weapon that kills them in two shots. What's worse is how the weapon had a hell of a lot of backup ammo in it to compensate for it, and you could even get your ammo back, slowly but surely, making it one of the most overpowered primary weapons in the entire game.  As the days flew by, more and more DLC came out, with more overpowered weapons, but nobody seemed to care. You'd still get idiots who would ♥♥♥♥ up Death Wish lobbies every single time, no matter what. Fastforward a little to the release of Golden Grin Casino, and Sokol. This is where I drew the line.  Here's a special perk deck you can equip that lets you REGENERATE YOUR HEALTH BY DEALING DAMAGE.  I mean, what? Payday has always been a series about careful resource management, making sure you had enough ammo and health to survive a push to the next objective, but now you're removing that trait altogether by adding in this pay to win tripe? And this was miles before the microtransaction pay to win scandal, too, but nobody wanted to bat an eye at this DLC, did they?  The weapons got so overpowered, Overkill had to call in a huge weapons rebalance, which made every single weapon ridiculously powerful. There was no need to spec your skill points into what weapons you wanted to use anymore, oh no. There's no point in that when your pistol kills everything in two headshots at any range.  They tried to nerf the health regen perks. Oh, they tried. But when you're keeping in a core concept that's against how the game's supposed to be played in the first place, no matter how hard you nerf it, it's still there.  Health-Regen killed Payday 2. Shame on you, Overkill. A new difficulty being introduced even now wouldn't change a thing. All it'd do is make the extremely overpowered health regen even more viable. You've ♥♥♥♥ed up your game beyond even human comprehension.",-1,0
5231225,400,Portal,"Portal. Probably my favorite video game of all time (My profile picture should be a tipoff, although i guess only to people who have already played it). Keep in mind, I'm not one to speak lightly. Now I only have about 20 hours in this game, whereas I have hundreds of hours in other games like tf2 and cs go. And it should be obvious why; Portal is just a single player game, and a short one at that. But when it comes to what video game has affected me the most, Portal still has no equal. Most people just play through this game and regard it as a unique little game that provides a few hours of fun, and that's pretty much it. Maybe they're right. Maybe I'm just crazy. In truth, no game has ever had as much of an impact on me as portal. To this day it blows me away the genius that went into this little game that was supposed to be a side title. Unfortunately I couldn't really go into what about this game is so amazing without spoiling it, and you'd better experience it for yourself. Listening to the developer commentary afterward further displays the genius of this game. The things these visionaries talk about stand in stark contrast to the type of dev commentary in portal 2, which, in a nutshell, is 'Playtesters on average liked this joke the best so we used it.' This was also the first Valve game I ever played, and while I have since gone on to play just about every other major Valve game (except Dota 2) extensively, no game holds the place in my heart that this one has, and always will.  I don't think I will ever again see a game that blows me away quite like Portal.",1,0

And more loot with different looks than you'll find anywhere but an Elder Scrolls game.

Despite the bad reviews I bought the game anyway because the first one was so good.  Many people have mentioned the instability of this game. I had 1 crash in the 32 hours it took me to complete the game. I bought the game about a month or two after it's release, so perhaps complaints about it's instability are a relic of the very early days after release.  The second complaint that many people have had is with the timers. I actually LIKE the timers in this game. They lead to some incredibly dramatic moments during my campaign. On in particular that I remember, is having to rush an advent position right next to my evac zone and barely getting my squad out as the time expired. The timers remove the move, overwatch, repeat tactic that dominated the first game and became a little bit arduous - especially in the late game.  I found the story line to be very engaging. I spent some late nights where I told myself, 'I'll just complete this mission... ok, I'll just play the meta game until the next mission... ok, I'm really not hungry so I could probably skip dinner and play one more mission... ok, I should go to bed but just one more...'  The only criticism that I would have regarding this game is the lack of tech layers. There are really only 3 for weapons and armour. However with that said there are a lot of options in this game and I plan to do a second play through to check out the things that I didn't build/utilize in the first play through.

315911,12220,Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City,"It's hard to NOT reccomend EFLC. I mean yes, it still has some glaring issues from its brother, GTA 4, such as the just rather grey and depressing Liberty City (and TLaD doesn't do much to fix this, especially when it adds that grainy filter), the PC port (which I'll talk about more later) is still random, sometimes it will run great, other times it's like playing a slide show, and all of it varies from PC to PC. I've seen fixes that helped improve performance for some by 20 frames, and then when I try it it does nothing to the performance. But overall, you're getting a very solid package with EFLC.  TLaD:  This expansion in my opinion has the stronger story of the two, but the weaker world. You are 'Johnny the Jew' part of a biker gang that has been on the fall since its peak in the 60s. The leader of your bike gang begins to go crazy with power, and starts a war with the AoD (Angels of Death), and as you can imagine, chaos ensues. I'm going to leave the story off from that since as I said it really is quite the ride, and if you liked GTA 4's story you'll really enjoy TLaD as Rockstar really managed to combine the stories quite well with several crossovers from Niko. This was the first game in a long time that I sat down and beat the story in one sitting, it really is that good in my opinion.  However, if you DON'T like GTA 4's focus on story and grim approach, TLaD probably isn't for you. Now, that's not to say if you didn't like Niko's story you won't like Johnny's, as they are quite different, but Johnny's story is still very grim compared to other GTA stories (not to say it doesn't have its share of laugh out loud moments and some absurdity thrown in there).   But if you're expecting this to bring the insanity of GTA:SA combined with a ton of unique side missions, TLaD is not for you. The only notable side missions include a new race mode with bikes and you now have the option to hit oppenents with bats to throw them off course, and a 'gang wars' side mission which is cool on paper, with X-COM style mechanics in the sense that the more you use a gang memeber with out them dying the better they become in battle, but when they die that's it, they're dead and you have to start all over again with a new memeber. But the AI is just not good enough to make it worth your time, and often my team mates would die from a bomb I threw at a car that my team mates are trying to ram, no matter how hard I try to get them to get away. Also there are only like 5 scenarios that just repeat through out the 25 side missions, and only a few lines of dialogue that the characters just repeat over and over again. You do get some guns from doing it, but if you've already beaten the story, chances are you have a ton of ammo for these guns already.  Overall I give TLaD a 8/10:  Pros: Great Story Great mechanics Some fun new toys Overall solid expereince Great Voice Acting  Cons:  World feels lacking Grainy filter makes the game look ugly and even more washed out   TBoGT:  This expansion without a shadow of a doubt is one that every fan of the GTA series should play. The story, while not as strong as TLaD, wraps up many, if not all lose ends from GTA 4 and TLaD. The world is great fun with loads of side missions that will keep you busy for hours and hours. And you get some fantastic toys that brings back some of that absurdity many loved from GTA:SA.  You are Luis Lopez, a former criminal who was involved with a lot of drug dealing in Northern Algonquin, but has since moved to Downtown Algonquin and changed his life around. He's now making a lot more money, works night clubs, and is the body guard of Tony Prince (Gay Tony) a once big shot going through a mid-life crisis, threatened by the closing of his night clubs under a new law in Liberty City, and he owes money to just about every major gang in Liberty City...I think you see where this is going. So through a 6-8 hours long story you'll go from blowing up cranes, highjacking trains, and riding planes. It truly is a fun time with some of the best missions in the GTA 4 trilogy. Also, the start of this expansion is in my opinion the best of the series.   TBoGT also has a fantastic world, and in my opinion is more engaging than even GTA 4's. You have fight night matches, an awesome racing mode that has you jump out of a helicopter, land in a boat, then drive to a car, and race in the cars which also have nitrous, it really is fun. On top of that you have club managment which is...so-so it's rather boring as you just watch over the crowd for a few minutes but every time you do it you get a mission from some celeberity at the end of your shift, this ranges from simply escorting them from paparazzi to spraying people down with a fire truck, it feels very familiar to the wackiness in Saints Row 2, which is definitly not a bad thing. You also get base jumping side missions, which are really fun. You'll be jumping out of helicopters, off of buildings, and off of motorcycles mid-air, and it feels very similar to GTA:SA. And finally, you get some 'Drug War' missions, which are very similar to the 'Gang Wars' from TLaD, the only difference being they got rid of the X-COM mechanics and instead of just killing everyone, you normally have a goal to steal the 'product' and cash and get it to a safe location without it blowing up or you dying. It's fun for the first few times, but just like the gang wars it's really just like 5 scenarios repeated and the dialogue begins repeating.  TBoGT will pretty much appeal to anyone that has liked a GTA game in the past, and in my opinion that's fantastic.  Overall I give TBoGT a 10/10. Must play.   The overall package is fantastic, and well worth your money. Rockstar did it again.     PC PERFORMANCE:  Yeah, so I'm going to be frank here, if you don't have a decent PC in TODAY standards, you may want to consider getting this on console. Now-a-days the game is so cheap on both platforms it's worth getting the PC version anyways just to mess around with mods, even if the game doesn't run so hot for you. But on my 660 and i5-3470 rig this game runs very poor, especially for its age and the visuals. The frame-drops in the game are just really strange, I've gone from 140fps in one second to 30 in the next, it's just all over the place, and I STRONGLY reccomend putting V-sync on to stop this, even though V-sync locks the fps at 55...seriously what the heck were you thinking Rockstar? Oh yeah, and the benchmark is pointless, unlike other games like Metro: LL where the benchmark pushes your PC to the limit and you'll never encounter that heavy of a load in game, the benchmark is really easy on your PC and I get almost double the fps average in the benchmark than I do in game...   There are some fixes out there that are worth a try but I couldn't find one that worked for me. Also if you have more than 2GB of Vram the game won't let you change the settings (there are some fixes to this, just google it). And on top of it all, this game uses not ONE, not TWO, but THREE DRM services...including GFWL...yeah.  So the PC port is pretty abysmal I must say, and I hope Rockstar treats the PC version of GTA V with more care (they better, considering how long we've waited). That being said, if you have the PC to run it well, this is WAY better looking than the console version, especially now that the shadows actually look like shadows and not blobs! And there are some cool PC exclusive features like your own radio station that plays your own songs, some improved animations, and the ability to save video clips and edit them together. Also, if you're like me and had a XBL account GFWL isn't all bad, as you can still get into private chats with people using the XB1 and 360, so that's sorta neat.",1,0

3976741,311010,The Way,"Well, this is definitely the most polarizing game I've played in a while. I backed this game, but later forgot about it, so when I started playing I had absolutely no recollection of the plot, what little I might have known. That was a good thing: this game has probably the BEST beginning half-hour I've seen since the first half of Wall-E. No words, no dialogue, just the acts and thoughts of the main character, and they tell you everything that you need to know in order to empathise with him. This feeling of discovery actually lasts for quite a while, since even after getting to the alien planet I was amazed by everything that I came into contact with, like a genuine explorer of a new world... that is, until I left the first part of the game, which I call 'Story World', and I arrived at 'Puzzle World'.  --------------------------------- SPOILER ALERT --------------------------------  From this moment on, the plot just sits patiently in a corner until you're done with the puzzles, then tells you a little bit of how the story goes on, then sits again to let you jump, climb, teleport and move green pieces all around. This is when the game started to lose me, but I pressed on, mainly because the story was interesting, but also because the puzzles were, at times, really damn ingenious. There are some here and there where I just had to roll my eyes in disbelief (Sliding puzzles? Really?), but they were really interesting to crack for the most part.  Then we arrive at the third part of the game, 'Action World', where high precision jumps are the norm and hundreds of deaths are the punishment for failure. This is where the writers' inspiration seems to have run out: the last thing I expected to see in a heavily dramatic, plot-driven game such as this one is a stage where you have to fight the Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion and the zombie pirate LeChuck. Yes, I know, 'it's an hommage', right? Well, for me, an hommage is a picture in the background, a statue on the floor, or a few notes of a recognisable tune, not modelling an action level of your dramatic game with characters from other games, brilliant and influential as they might be. And having a bullet hell stage as the final boss, in a game with a plot that doesn't really need any kind of 'final boss', is just lazy writing to me.  Finally, at the end of the story it is revealed that the 'immortality solution' which the main character has been searching all his life is just storing a person's mind in a computer, something which I'm pretty sure that his own society already had the ability to do. I mean, they have perfected interstellar travel and full-body stasis chambers, yet they can't make a copy of the neuronal network of a person? It just doesn't make sense. And the ending? A few still images transitioning from one to another. That's it. No emotion at all. Oh, and the worst part: a cliffhanger at the end. Just perfect.  --------------------------------- SPOILER END ---------------------------------  All in all, it saddens me that a game with such a brilliant beginning (again, one of the best written and executed I've ever seen) gradually devolved into an uninspired succession of puzzles and action sequences, some even completely outside the context of the story. Even so, I recommend everyone to play this game, even if it's just for the parts where the plot comes back with new evolution for our main character and the inhabitants of the world he's exploring. Oh, and for the fantastic, submersive and delightful soundtrack, arguably the best character of the game.",1,0

5412938,418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"As a RWBY fan, I wanted this game very much. And for a company's first foray into the games industry, I gotta commend it.  RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is fun, however it is reliant on multiplayer. Playing alone is very punishing, I died four times in the first 3 levels on normal difficulty. Its extremely obvious that this game was made to be a multiplayer game. I am yet to play multiplayer, but I think when I do the experience will be much more rewarding.  Its not a bad game, its just a shallow one. There isn't a lot to do in it, and essentially you're running through linear levels beating up bad guys, which is fun. But on your own the fun wears thin. The game *needs* human interaction, and a game should never rely on its multiplayer component. Even if a game is designed for multiplayer it needs to stand up on its own as well.  I'm happy with my purchase and would definately reccomend it to a friend, if nothing else so that I had someone to play with. But definately buy it now while $5 has been knocked off the price.

The tactical combat is interesting enough, but this facet of the game is easily overshadowed by the interesting and challenging choices you are asked to make as the narrative progresses.  If you enjoy story-driven games and/or a good fantasy novel, Banner Saga is a must play. If you're a hardcore fan of tactics games, Banner Saga doesn't break any new ground there.

Having read some not entirely positive reviews, I my expectations were not that high, but I have enjoyed the Civ games since the early days of Civ1, so I figured it was worth a try.  After 250hours+ of gameplay, I have to say I have really enjoyed this game. I certainly found it more entertaining than Civ5 (which I also have the two expansions for), and right now I would much prefer to play CivBE:RT than Civ5.  I really like the affinities, and I love the way that units auto-upgrade as affinities rise. I enjoy the quests, I like the new diplomacy system, and I think the gameplay is more addictive. Overall, I just enjoy the game.#  It does have its faults.

591977,204300,Awesomenauts,"First paid game I've ever uninstalled. Fun while it lasted, but looking back I would be in a happier place if I had burned my $9.99 instead.  The wins are fun, the losses are beyond awful. Unfortunately, wins quickly become fewer and farther between because of a TERRIBLY balanced league system. This is pretty well discussed in various forums, so do some research and you'll see that this game is not a fun long term experience. They bump up your league for no reason, and you spend the rest of your tenure being the worst player in every single match until you realize that you haven't had fun in weeks.  Characters are well balanced overall, but the strengths and weaknesses create laughable individual game matchups. Certain characters absolutely cripple others. And the game doesn't show you who has chosen whom, so you don't know until you've sat through each endless lobby that your lineup stands no chance. No strategic counter picking. Just 'oh great, a team of X, Y, and Z. There goes the next 30 minutes of my life.'  The community...awful. Angry, angry kids and racists.",-1,0

It's a game that entertains you and makes you think, the story is great and includes so many really good ideas all wrapped neatly together into a coherent string.

The story is based on an old Iñupiaq tale, a symbolic legend of a civilization that has been dealing with nature's hardships for centuries.   An amazing game with a heartwarming story. I enjoyed every second of my playthrough, especially the cultural insights. I believe I learned more about this fascinating culture through playing this game than I would have reading a book about it, simply because you hear the stories from the people themselves. Through the chapters, you will encounter several collectibles. Each of them unlocks a short video - a cultural insight featuring people from the community talking about what it was like to grow up in the region's unforgiving cold.  The game length is around 4-6 hours, depending on your skills, but for the 4-6 hours you are playing it, you are transported into the Alaskan way of life with the stunningly beautiful graphics as well as the narrator telling the story in his native tongue.

3972977,310950,Street Fighter V,"I'll keep it to the point:  Pros A must buy for Street Fighter enthusiasts and those who are simply interested in the mechanics of the game.  A small sized cast, but each character varies quite widely, so there is someone to play for everyone.  Great in game graphics and music.  Great fighting game mechanics, much more pick up and playable than previous fighting games (especially SF games). Very honest and fair, and balanced game. No character match up feels unbeatable (apart from maybe Zangief vs Fang, but that's closer to a 9-1 match up than a 10-0).   The mechanics allow for hype come backs as chip damage cannot kill unless using an ultimate (critical art).  No 1 frame links, all links are 3 frame, but in return mechanics like V reversal and decision making are much more pivital allowing for newer players to enjoy the game quicker whilst making a very clear distinction between the good and the great players.  Matches can be set to auto find whilst doing other things (like story mode, challenge mode or training) So you can play the game whilst waiting for an opponent.  The lounges have been expanded to 8 players allowing for easy king of the hill round robin tournaments.  You really care if you lose, of all the fighting games me and my friends have played, this game has got us the saltiest because it's the fairest. If you lose, 95% of the time, its because you straight up played worse.  Neutral  Ranked matches are found semi quickly for me, but it really depends where you live, this game is no where near as fast as Pokken Tournament however it's not super slow either.  The ranking system is fair, I prefer this system to league of legends, but sometimes match making can put you up against someone far too strong or weak.   Cons  Would appriecate more stages.  An actual tutorial which involves each characters bread and butter move set would be a great help for new players. However all we have are demonstration tutorials and challenge mode which goes from easy to far too difficult, without showing the medium difficulty combos which is what everyone actually needs to learn first.  There is no punishment for people leaving games during ranked net play (someone can disconnect before the game ends and no LP is lost, this NEEDS to be fixed).  Best of 3's need to be made mandatory rather than optional within ranked.  Getting colours in this game is balls to the wall difficult. I completed easy on every character without any trouble, granting them all 1 additional costume colour, then I completed Cammy's medium level difficulty, which took sometime. Hard and Hell mode are damn near impossible unless you are a god at this game. Easy mode = 10 matches for 1 colour Medium Mode = 30 matches for 3 colours Hard Mode = 50 matches for 5 colours (I believe it was 5) Hell Mode = Special profile title. Lose 1 match and it's game over, and the AI after round 15 or so in hard mode cranks up to Japanese arcade timecrisis difficulty. It just wants your quaters!  Do not buy yet if your looking for a story. Many characters and the story mode aren't available yet.   Summary - If you like street fighter or fighting games in general, this is a great game to get and a perfect game to introduce new players into the street fighter world. However if you are looking for a game like mortal kombat or tekken, with cinematic and exciting cutscene story telling, an arcade mode and other features like towers, do not buy this game (yet, wait till june). Overall, I have a blast with this game, but that's because it's in my competitive nature. Recommended.",1,1

Plain and simple. Also if you cross the field into no man's land, yeah you might as well write your own obituary right then and there. I love how realistic it is and how you really need to work together in order to win any of the mactes.

6341553,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,"'Just One more Turn!' is Civilizations unofficial motto, anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand. Known as the biggest turn-based strategy game today with it's rather unique hexagon tiled playfield, Civilization has entertained many throughout it's lifespan - myself included. I used to play a bunch load of Civilization III as a kid and Civilization V has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years. Back in the days, turn-based strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are real-time. Turn-based means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time, like in every traditional board game.  Evidently Sid Meier's Civilization V is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game, the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game. The fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best Civilization game, a lot of people still prefer Civ IV, personally I love Civ III a lot but Civ V takes the prize. The main problem with Civilization V when it came was the lack of content compared to what Civ IV already had. Today, 4 years later, tons of DLCs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than it's predecessor.  The game is about to create, reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside, either online or vs computers. Explore, expand, exploit and exterminate - 4X - is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of Civilization. Explore is for the first section of the game, where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents. Expand is when your small settlement becomes several, either through settling another one or through conquest. Exploit is the description of diplomacy, treaties, spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate. Exterminate is pretty obvious, if diplomacy or expantion does not work, take the matter by the sword (or the nuclear warhead).  There are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization; Cultural, Diplomatic, Scientific and by Domination. Along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories. For example; you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches. Essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory, units for domination or technology for science. You could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way. I was hoping to see a pure Economical and Religious victory condition, but sadly there are none.  It feels like I have done pretty much everything in Civilization V since it's release but I still get really tempted to get back in there, and just let the hours disappear. Suddenly you sit there, 5 AM in the morning and be like 'What the hell just happened? I am not 12 anymore, I have a f*cking job!'. I remember when I used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks, I couldn't even think of something else for 5 minutes! 'Just One more Turn!' I am really looking forward to Civilization VI and Civilization: Beyond Earth.    I recommend Civilization V for everyone, not just strategy fans but everyone interested in having control and making decisions for an imaginary empire. Or if you just have a lot of time to spend, I ensure you that you won't be disappointed. ",1,0

1901576,232790,Broken Age,"A tenuous reccomendation from me. If you've played any adventure games in the last 10 years or so, Broken Age wont surprise you in any way. What is available in Act 1 is very well produced, and there are more than a few interesting spots to explore, but overall the worlds feel rather empty. There aren't a lot of random things to click on that aren't a part of the story, which is one of my favorite parts of any adventure game. You can try to combine some of the items to humerous effect, but that's pretty much it. It's a very straightforward and linear experience, and characters vanish as soon as they are no longer useful. It feels rushed storywise, which is insanity considering how long it's been since we all put down money on the Kickstarter. Of course, a story's beginning without its end is almost useless, so I can't be too hard on it right now. In any case, it is worth a playthrough, but I'm not sure that $25 is the right price, even with another half of the game yet to be released.",1,0

3400212,278620,TinyKeep," https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZC5xVD0uv4&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLTj9drPC92M2iXZVy0bCpf02SUE8zLaKG   Tiny Keep is a rogue-lite dungeon escaping experience. The art style is  simplistic, with basic options that may or may not appeal to your taste. The themes of the individual levels stay mostly the same, but unfortunately the balance  of difficulty is uneven. This can deter newer players or those who enjoy a slow buildup of difficulty as they progress.   One difference from level to level can be found in the layout of the map levels. There are traps on each level, and while not a deterrant, you can use them to your own advantage to trap or kill your enemy. The traps break after so much damage has been done to the traps, which I appreciate.  The camera angle is a mix of third person and top down; that tied down with the screen shake of the camera can lead some to become dizzy or nauseousas they progress. The camera angle also can be very disorienting as you try to find your way through the  levels.  The gameplay itself is very simplistic; a hack and slash primal kill experience. If that's what you're looking for, it can be good. There is very little in the way of tactics or combination of gear sets or powerups. The game accomplishes what it sets out to do very well, but it pushes the difficulty level too fast too soon, combined with the seasick feeling of the camera angle makes me hesitantly recommend it. This would be a good purchase to get on sale.   This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.

6307859,8850,BioShock 2,"Good stories don't necessarily make good games, but great games are made up of strong stories (and fancy-♥♥♥ graphics, ultra-cool features, superb characters etc). BioShock was a great story (and all the other above listed too). From the moment you stepped into Rapture, the game lured you in for a psychological ride, where there is no right and wrong, no black and white. And trust me, it does it more subtly and better than many other titles. For me personally, BioShock stands as the only game that has made me hit the pause button and stare at the screen for 10 minutes, just going through it all. So, BioShock 2 then? In all shortness, if you loved the deep atmospheric world of the once-great Rapture, the horror of Splicers luring in the dark (and the satisfaction of killing them in a dozen different ways) and the philosophy of Andrew Ryan unravel at you, then BioShock 2 is a must to play.

While there are some things that can be annoying to think about (like non-main character's voice acting being absurdly low quality, which is probably due to cutting corners for Xbox/Ps3 discs, fall damage, getting stuck and VERY annoying tigers that soak up bullets like a sponge) The game itself is a lot of fun, if you give it a chance. The controls are tight and you can remap buttons to your playstyle. My most favorite thing about this game are the combat scenarios, you have the choice in how you want to approach things. You can go loud and mow down everyone in your path, or you can be stealthy and kill without being seen. Or you can do a fine mixture of both, the wide variety of weapons including C4, flamethrower, and many different guns that feel realistic and are fun to use (no more obnoxious jamming that was prevelant in Far Cry 2.)

532671,203160,Tomb Raider,"totalbiscuit's description was fairly accurate, but I didn't enjoy this game. first of all the plot is so predictable and cliché that is was more annoying than enjoyable, because come on, it's the same basic maja-ish ritual magic story in which nothing makes sense, also stupid plot devices, and don't move the story forward in any way. I won't spoil it too much, but you make a disstress call, and the help you've asked gets destroyed, and in that part which took like 2 hours was completely useless and didn't progress the story in any way. Also notable was that it could have been directed by Michael Bay, almost everything explodes or gets destroyed, also some actions made by lara are not really survivable, like falling from real high, to getting wounds (because the plot says she has to have one) and are forgotten after 10 minutes of gameplay. Pretty awesome gameplay mechanics used a single time, there are also no surviving mechanics accept hunting which you do once and don't have to do the rest of the game, enemies on weird unreachable places like on high pillars, which then move and then magically disappear. the transaction between scared girl and mass murderer happens in one cutscene in which some bad guy gets killed, cries for 2 minutes about it and then starts killing everyone. It pretends that the game isn't linear, but it actually is because in most cases you don't have to get back, and is kind of weird because pretty often the path is destroyed or inacessable.

The AI is not very good (although a slight improvement on Rome 2) and there is actually a relatively small amount of content in this game (at least compared to previous titles). It would seem all the money in this game went on the ip and art (models, maps, animations etc ...) with very little gone into basic mechanics or thought as to how the game should play.  Pros - Models look good - Warhammer - Orkz - Game actually works on launch for a change  Cons - Lack of gameplay or stategic diversity - Simplfied campaign - Only 5 playable factions - Short replayability factor - No semblance of balance between the factions  This game is still worth playing but I would recommend waiting till you can pick it up for half price or at least till the modders make the game remotely interesting.",-1,1

1532328,223510,Miasmata,"Buy? Likely  -=TL;DR=- Miasmata is a unique, first-person survival exploration game where the player must stave off symptoms of a deadly fever that accelerates thirst, weakens the body and somehow either through hallucination or some sort of attraction affect, spawns a deadly, nearly indescribable horror simply referred to the creature. This beast is basically invincible, faster than you and can kill you in two claw swipes. The player must use a combination of cartography and chemistry to find and use plant life across the island of Eden to mitigate and eventually cure his ailment. Miasmata enforces the fact that you are a frail person, collecting herbs while managing thirst and fatigue, and gave me a sense of dread and fear that no horror game has ever given me.  -=Presentation=- This is both arguably the best and worse part of the game. Upon getting off the canoe at the start, you're present a beautifully lit island with loads of flora, ambience and world design that immediately immerses you in the world. Yet, the minute you turn around to look at your boat or bother to look at your hands are the ground below you, the models and textures are only barely better than a PS2 era game. It's extremely jarring to see a world that looks much like Skyrim with ENB and flora mods, but with textures only moderately better than Morrowind. Standing water around the island looks great, but beyond that, there is no volumetric water: The water you drink from ponds is invisible and the water poured from pitchers are literally solid beads that would only look like water from a far distance. Also, the draw distance and level of detail is kind of atrocious for a game that looks like this - world details (rocks, plants) within 8-12 feet in front of you update model quality or pop-in out of nowhere like some sort of hologram effect from a sci-fi movie. It severely ruins the immersive experience the developers were trying to create, and it's strange why there is no included options to manage level of detail for stronger PCs.  In spite of all the visual presentation issues, you can often find many screenshot worthy moments as the sun light, god rays, water reflection, cloud and tree shadows have an effect on the medium-low quality environment, proving that lighting effects can drastically improve the look of a game.  The audio presentation is pretty good. There are appropriate sound effects for any action in the game from walking on dirt, wood, or rocks, to swimming, drinking water to swinging a weapon and opening up the map or journal. There are occasional sound cues when turning on lights. The majority of you sound will be in the form of blowing wind, rushing waters, lively critters, and of course, the roars of the godforsaken beast and the heartbeat the PC has the moment it gets near you. The occasional music that plays as you discover camps and various settlements is of a light, symphonic, ambient mood.  -=Gameplay=- I can't believe I said so much about the presentation - the gameplay and mechanics are always the most important factors of a game to me. You are Robert Hughes, and you must cure your plague. You will gradually find notes and clues about harvesting ingredients, discovering locations, and using cartography to map your position. Yes, Cartography. There are no waypoints or Skyrim-esque 'quest objective is right here!' map markers here, though campsites, statues and other landmarks are marked on your paper map as you properly locate them via triangulation or partial maps across the island. It is easy to get lost among the trees and mountains and it is generally best to use landmarks, trails, coastlines, and various 'world formations' in tandem with collected partial maps and your compass to get an idea of where you are and where you are going.  You can pick up and throw items like fruit, rocks, axes, knives, and household objects, though it's all there to remind you that you are a frail person - none of these except from fire made from torches are even remotely useful in dealing with the creature. Combat only exists for the creature. This means you must hide or bore the creature enough to get away from it. You can run, but it's not always suggested as it can catch up to you almost immediately. It stalks you slowly when you walk and it's best to look around and find a good path to move, before finally running to a building to hide in or a object to hide behind.   The problem with running in this game is not only the creature faster than you, but you are easily fatigued unless you prepared yourself with endurance medicine you made from plant life. Plus, Robert has a bit of a 'Sonic syndrome' where he has a hard time running up hills and sprints madly down hills. You have to manage this inertia by carefully finding proper pathways around and avoiding steep falls, since he is a clumsy idiot who can barely control his movement apparently, and will contract a fever that will blur your vision and slow your movement if you fall. It's a bit of a nuisance to control the character and it will definitely make many gamers dislike Miasmata. Though, if the game had a normal first person movement system, much of the tension would be lost since you're no longer accidentally running into the creature and not struggling to get up hills. Because of that, I cautiously welcome it - after all I would probably use slopes to increase my speed if I needed too.  The bulk of the game is finding herbs and fungi to research for medicines, drinkable temporary buffs, injectable permanent buffs and eventually the cure. You get clues on what to use from notes around the island and personal examinations on plants. Just be careful with your limited storage bin, 3 holdable plants and ease of dropping them if you trip and fall.  -=Summary=- Miasmata is a tense survival game that definitely helped scratch my itch for exploration. It offered an non-combat experience I've never had before and made me legitimately scared of the creature until I knew how to exploit it (unfortunately, he more annoying than scary in the near end game). I'm definitely glad I played it, though I wish there was an improved, modded, or sequel version. Though, it's movement mechanics and map system will turn off many gamers. Definitely play this if you're looking for exploration, survival and tension.",1,0

I purchased this game+season pass during the original release, and chose not to go through the refund process in the hopes that Warner Bros. would do right by their consumers in offering a working game, and offer all DLC content to Season Pass owners. Instead, the game is still not working correctly, Season Pass owners are shafted and have to buy certain DLC content separately, and those that already have all of the games in their library get no benefits from Warner Bros.' blunders.  This experience has been the last straw for me. I will no longer commit to pre-orders, and WB has lost a consumer today. I admired the content that they published for their games, even apologized flaws and shortcomings. But this is just completely unacceptable. Even understanding that you can't make everyone happy by gifting games, I can't help but feel penalized for being optimistic and hoping that everything would be made right at re-release. Why should I support paying the price for another full game through Season Pass, when its concept is disjointed and incomplete?

2272547,241540,State of Decay,"The closest to feeling like a zombie apocalypse that I've ever seen in an open world game.  The basic controls are adequate for whatyou want to do, the game switches well between stealth elements, melee and ranged combat, and social and resource management systems make it feel even less linear than the open world setting does.  Difficulty is generally forgiving, but the game autosaves and won't let you save more than one file, so the permadeath element is strictly enforced: in fact I have restarted the game once already due to a black fever outbreak and will do so again as my main protagonist just ran away from one swarm right into another and he's my best melee fighter.   The difficulty goes down when you've got NPC survivors with you, but the game is quite specific about alowing this (remember the resource management) and so you'll experience much of the game in the solo mode, which can get genuinely frightening at times. Often you'll be searching a building at night when a horde is making its way along an adjacent road, but you're not sure if the building you're in is empty. As well as trying to keep noise &amp; light discipline whilst searching, you need to be on guard for something sneaking up on you or cutting off your escape routes.  The clipping is a bit of an issue, but everything else in the game comes together really well, and being on Steam and XBLA it's easily patched, so it should only get better.  Definitely worth a look, with more open world DLC on the way and a multiplayer being spoken about. Also, at only £15 (or less in sale)",1,0

Your sort of at the mercy of these guys in some cases. This is where you might find a little flaw in the game. Sometimes minions won't do things as fast as you want or react to an intruder unless you tag or notify them. I had a tourist end up in my freezer. This guy walked right past a hallway full of minions and ended up in the freezer. Not to mention as I was locking the tourist up, investigators came in and started taking pictures.

While I'm technically still new to this game, I will say this game keeps me well entertained. From building to managing my minions on the world map, there's so much to do. Placing traps is also quite fun. Just make sure you get traps placed at the main entrance early. This may save you from having idiots trapped in your freezer. Just don't go too willy nilly on things you may not need right away. I had to start over after I accidentally wasted money on stuff I didn't need at that moment.

It is true that the game is kind of pay to win, but you can take advantage of events and you should be fine. I spend about 20 bucks on the game....not sure whether I regret it or not. I know there are a lot of not-recommends in this section because the balance is not exactly the best, and there are occassional lags in pvp. We've came to expect so much from this game that we get pretty upset if it doesn't meet our standards. The truth is, you won't play this forever. In fact, you might get bored in about a week, but this game does offer a great MMO experience. With only $20 spend, I would say that I am doing pretty well in the game PVP and PVE wise. I can go as far as SSS rank in pvp with just simple spar gear, but it does that time and experience with your character. I have made about 7 characters in the game that are all very useable. They are able to stand up to the game and all it's problems. Overall, this is a very good game. Try it out. It doesn't hurt. Don't pvp until at least lv 70. Take advantage of the events. I hope you find this review useful :)",1,0

1026794,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"I own nearly all of the previous 'Total War' games but delayed purchasing Rome 2 for a little over a month after it became available in the hope that any bugs had been fixed. Well, not all had but it now seems to be generally the case. The game is spread over a very wide geographical area and is quite absorbing though it is difficult to see what some actions other than direct conflict have actually done. Fun all the same. I have to admit that I spend a lot of time on the custom battles which are definitely great fun, which is the object of it all.The bottom of the list in these custom battles (to me) are the naval conflicts - nothing particularly bad, that's just how it is. All the others, land battles, river battles, defended and undefended ports and cities etc get my attention fairly equally. It is frustrating when I forget to reset the time limit which is left at 20 minutes and the game advises I have lost.... no I haven't! What is very impressive is the programming, in my view a real achievement. From time to time a pack of wolves or a lion can be seen in the distance. Large birds float by overhead and zooming in closer to foresty the more birdsong and insects can be heard.Soldiers on the march and stood waiting are good, I think I can see them breathing and blinking. The detail of their armour etc is high. Vegetation detail is good and very varied. The time of day is well presented, for example if late afternoon then the shadows from the soldiers is correct and moving in time. The sun and clouds alter as time progresses. I really like when it's raining, the soldiers are definitely wet and rain is even spattering on the monitor screen. It's frustrating when it's foggy, the enemy is hard to see (of course), watch out. The AI is somewhat weak in one or two areas but this doesn't severely detract from the game. Also the soldiers' comments are clearly not appropriate when sometimes spoken but again not a problem. After the battle when the soldiers are tired or exhausted and splattered with blood ('blood and gore' required), some are leaning over, many are pleased and banging their swords on their shields and cheering, one or maybe two are being sick, and the soldiers are moving individually a great deal, this all lends a lot of game realism. In the battle itself, moving in close to the fighting is pretty realistic and individually independant, soldiers can be seen mortally wounded on their knees before they fall completely down. And more. Also liked is the cinematic mode, where the player can ride along with the cavalry or march with the legionaries. I have to say I use a reasonably game friendly computer and therefore see a lot of available detail (Intel i7, 16 gB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX760 graphics. I play on max graphics with the computer Ram memory made available). Of course there are a few areas where criticism can be made such as the AI as stated - show me a complicated animated game where there isn't. There are plenty of whingers and also some reasonable criticism - in my view overall Rome 2 is the best of the sequence yet.",1,0

I bought this game as soon as it came out and I can confidently say that althought it used to be 2, there are now 3 games that I permanently keep and play.  Rocket League is hours and hours of fun with strangers and friends alike! Games last 6 minutes on average and I think the longest was 10 minutes so it's safe to say this is a pick up and play anytime game.  It's incredibly easy to pick up and once you master basic aerial moves, you'll have every chance of taking on Masters &amp; Legends.  Best thing is I've always found opponents. There has never been a time where I've turned on Rocket League and am waiting for more than a minute for a server.  I hope the devs keep up the amazing work and don't change the dlc set up. I happily pay for the dlc as it's very reasonably priced and the devs arent trying to force money out of you. If you dont want a car, dont buy it.

Also, the shipbreaking part is really dumb. yeah, look at this amazing 1000 year old tech... blow it up! Everything, other than the most important part - gameplay, is great. It was very empty.

It's too demanding for the laptop but when going on the big desktop it stutters every 30 sec. As I already spend hours to understands that actually Uplay don't get your saves in the cloud (what use is it then ? Don't know) and other hours spend trying to figure why it would constantly reset controllers setting when I plugged the pad (reason: because bug, here for months post release on steam. Finally fixed but that give you an idea of the QA service in Ubi), I gave up on spending more to fix stuttering on a game supposed to use a fraction on the horsepower of my rig. Especially when on the top of this on last quit it puts the xbox vibration on non stop. Had to unplug the thing.    I can't waste time on job so poorly done, Ubisoft. Especially when gameplay has gone wrong everywhere. At first it's pretty then you quickly realise it's very hard to read the action. Not enjoyable (sheer luck in random mess typically does the trick better than controlled moves), using that awful flying thing all the time, etc. Not playing this unless you pay me.

[Spoiler Ahead] The thing is, the story was alright, not really the 'greatest video game love story of our time' I thought I was going to get. I will admit I was touched at some parts but when it comes down to it the story is about a kid who drops out of highschool to runaway with her girlfriend after her paretns express their disproval. Now this would be very powerful if this was experienced through that character's perspective, but you're experiancing this from the perspective of her sister who has come home after being gone for atleast a year and finding the house is empty. So yeah, finding out my kid sister had ranway from home to be with her highschool sweet heart before I could even see her or talk this out with her had me less than enthused. Story I'd give a 6/10.  Now here is mostly why I wouldn't recommend it. The cost and the amount of time it will take you to finish it. The games origianal price is $20, and the game only has about an hour of gameplay, maybe more if you get stuck. I have nothing against a walking-simulator, I did enjoy exploring the house, but I feel that a game that can be completed in an hour isn't worth the steep cost of twenty bucks. Maybe if it was on sale for under $5 and you like story-based games, with good atmosphere and don't mind a lack of game-play, then it might be worth a playthrough, but it really isn't worth the full-price.",-1,0

There is just something soothing and satisfying about driving a truck around Europe doing deliveries. The game has its share of flaws as well, the biggest and most annoying being the AI. Although it was majorly overhauled in a recent update it still occasionally does do something utterly stupid and gives a good laugh. The game has good graphics, nice and bright colourful enviornment. Many of the simulation elements are also present. Overall this game is surely enjoyable if you have a taste for good simulators. This is not your usual crap of a so-called simulator like, dare I say, Air Control or Garbage Truck Simulator. This is a solid simulator made for the fan.

3745892,298630,The Escapists,"What is there to say about this game, it is fantastic. One of the reasons I say so is because of the great music, a game in my opinion can't be perfect if the music is bad. There is many types of music for different prisons and they all fit the theme very well. The gameplay is also very great. The prisons start off easy but get harder as you go on. The easy prisons are great tools for allowing you to understand the rules and ins and outs of the Mechanics and such. By the time you get to the harder prisons you are ready for them. The gameplay is difficult but not frustrating, it allows for mostly skill and your ingenius to put the pieces together. There is a bit of luck but not too much to make it completely luck but not completely skill. The game has a crafting system in it which makes a lot of sense. You might sometimes have to look them up but there are also crafting notes in the game which give you recipies for crafting. When ever you craft something it stores it in a database so you can look at how to craft something. Crafting is a essential part of escaping the prisons and makes it so much more fun searching for that last piece and the satisfaction when you find it. Another part of the game is the favors. You can accept favors from other immates to earn money, from crafting items, getting items back from other immmates, or just plain beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of other Immates. It creates a desire to make friends or enemies and do things for others in helping yourself leave. The final part is the combat and heat. When you press space, you enter combat mode, training your stength increases your health, and training your speed increases how fast you attack. You will do damage based on your weapon and there are different levels of strengths in weapons. Anything that you do that hurts immates or guards, climbing on desks or carrying illegal items will give you heat. If you have 99% heat, the guards will come for you and beat you until you're done.  In the end, do I recommend The Escapists? Hell yes, this game is awesome, from the music to genius game design, this is one game that I would recommend to a lot of people.  It gets a 9.99/10 (I hate luck)",1,0

571610,203810,Dear Esther,"This is a hard game to review or recommend. Not because it is bad - far from it - but rather, because it is so unique. Firstly, it is not a game whatsoever. Secondly, while the experience may stick with you for a lifetime, the actual time investment is only 1 to 2 hours from start to finish. So because of those two factors and taking into account the price, I can't blindly recommend it for everyone. However, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is open to new and unique experiences in the digital realm and doesn't mind the asking price to length ratio. As for the game itself, it basically consists of walking a mostly linear path for 2 hours while listening to narration and taking in some amazing visuals. The mysterious story is revealed in bits and pieces as you play, and you will likely need (and want!) to replay the game multiple times to piece it all together. In the end, think of Dear Esther not as a game, but as an amazing piece of interactive art.",1,0

1624452,224760,FEZ,"In general this game is  Amazing   The first time i heard from Fez was on 'Indie game: The movie' there i found it quite interesting as for the main mechanic, a 2D world which can be rotated to its 4 faces which actually makes it a 3D world, i had high expectations for the game thanks to comments i've read and amazing reviews here on steam, but at the end.... this game was a LOT better than what i expected, in my opinion it is a perfect game for everyone, the difficulty is high enough to be a challenge but not high enough to make it almost imposible to complete, and the end (  oh man that ending..  ) it's not actually the end because after that, you can choose to complete 100% which is VERY difficult, what i want to say is that everyone can get to the normal ending with a level of difficulty really good, and this can be very satisfying for most people, but if you want a real challenge, prepare, because Fez has some really hard extra challenges for you.  Apart from the puzzles you will find, Fez can be a very relaxing game, it has very beautiful art and an amazing soundtrack, there were lots of moments where i just stopped moving my character and just sit there on my chair listening to the amazingly made soundtrack.  The only con i found this game was that some of the puzzles required you to know (or to have) some extra knowledge/equipment that maybe not everyone has (like for example a QR code) which of course not everyone owns a smartphone, but this is mostly for getting a 100% so there is no much of a problem here.  Conclusion: 9.5/10 Buy it, it is very worth it, you won't regret, i promise  PD: I don't care about Phil, i just care about the game which for me was really good and i just have to congrat phil for the amazing idea this game has, and of course also every other developer involved in the making of Fez",1,0

6299101,8190,Just Cause 2,"I have a thumbs down review because, at the end of the day, the time I put into it ultimately didn't feel nearly as rewarding as it was in other games I've played. Honestly, I wish they had a score between thumbs up and thumbs down. This is by no means a bad game, but it's not one that I can recommend among other games I have played.  This game is always super cheap, and it is easily worth the three bucks I paid for it. That said, while it was worth every penny, it wasn't worth every hour. The gameplay is solid and engaging, but once you've played 2 hours you've seen everything this game has to offer. Also, I'm not a fan of the idea that to 'claim' an area, you are basically doing a collectible hunt.  EDIT: For the record: 'collectible hunt' doesn't just mean picking things up. There are also fuel tanks, radio towers, etc. However, I argue strongly that there is only a semantic difference between picking up a box or blowing up one of 3 different types of destructible object buried in corners of an area. It's still effectively a collectible hunt.  The game is an open-world third person shooter that has limited sandbox elements. Most of the game you spend generating 'Chaos' in order to unlock the next mission in either the main story-arc or the next mission in your faction. Unfortunately, causing 'chaos' generally means 'find the collectibles in uninteresting and repetive towns.' This is really where I got bored with the game super quickly. You spend more time just walking around areas staring at your proximity indicator to find collectibles than you will even come close to spending on missions. Honestly, the mission themselves can be enjoyable, but it's overshadowed by the simply silly amounts of 'collectible grinding' you have to do to unlock them.  Simply put, grinding 'chaos' points is where this game falls flat. It encourages you to spend inordinate amounts of time just walking around an area looking for the one or two collectibles/fuel tanks you missed without actually doing interesting missions.  Above all else, let me be clear. This game is NOT GTA on steroids. The only thing it has in common with GTA is an open-world, a third person camera, and the existence of cars and guns. That's it. It is a very different game.  GOOD -Surprisingly good gunplay for a third person open world shooter without a lock-on mechanic -Beautiful, vast world with diverse scenery -Long game with a lot of gameplay -Fantastic DPH (dollars per hour) entertainment value  BAD -Collectible hunting is fine for side missions, but this game requires you spent the vast majority of your time hunting collectibles. -Lack of depth; This game has amazing breadth, but incredibly little depth. There just simply isn't a whole lot of depth. -Once you've played 3 hours, you've seen everything except the scenery. -I lost interest in the story so fast I honestly forgot about it almost entirely. -Too much time is spent just travelling between areas without seeing anything interesting. The towns themselves get very repetitive. -Awkard control schemes at times. -Heat (wanted level) system is far more annoying than it is fun or challenging. -Ammo is expensive to buy, hard to find.  Is Just Cause 2 a bad game? No, of course not.  But if you're like me and have a working backlog of Steam Games to get to, I'd say this one is low priority. That said, the game has aged well, and will certainly have you entertained for a few hours even if you don't play too much into it. That can easily be worth the periodic super cheap price.",-1,0

You will be spending a lot of time trying to find resources for your group or yourself but with a small backpack you need to get used to making a decision about what is more important. A golf club to defend yourself or meds for your injured friend. Depending on your play style you will also have to regularly decide wheather it is worth fighting zombies for resources or if running for your life is the best option.  It would be a nice feature if we could create a customer character and create our own weapons but sadly that does not exist in the game. I sometimes found while moving the main character around that the character's animation will be running forward but the character himself will be running in a different direction. This made moving a little awkward at times especially when in combat. Combat is basicly just pressing the melee button or key till the zombie is dead which makes combat a little bland when there are only a few zombies.  Great game, very immersive and scary at times but could be improved.  8/10",1,0

418643,19680,Alice: Madness Returns,"So to begin with I persuaded myself this was a good game from what I had heard and ended up buying it on sale ( which made it an easier decision ) .  From first opening the game, the scenery is pretty and the story seems somewhat intriguing, however, this soon loses its appeal. I soon found myself in a spiral of simple mindless puzzles, repetition of pathway and 'fighting' a combination of weak or annoying enemys WITH, may I add, a small combination of weapons which last the entirity of the game and never get 'satisfying'.   As a linear game the story does progress, however, it feels slow and (to me) felt and feels like a chore to finish. I wanted to like this game, simply because of how crazy and pretty it was. It felt like as soon as you got a new outfit or something minor changed that perhaps this time something was going to happen, yet, alas, its the same all over again... Jump , turn a valve, jump, attack, jump, turn a valve, drop a bomb, jump, shrink, turn a valve.   Sadly, I would not reccommend this game, it's fun for a while but soon loses appeal.",-1,0

2917041,255420,,"Another Core set, another Duels of the Planeswalkers. This year we get something fans have been demanding since the first game in this series: custom deckbuilding, which is both this game's biggest draw, and its biggest drawback.  It's awesome in that it fully simulates the experience of playing the real game, and it allows you to make the type of deck you want to play - any combination you want, not just the 10 basic decks present in most DOTP games (with more available as DLC); you're free to play Bant, Esper, Gruul, whatever you want.  It's disappointing in that you're stuck with a relatively small card pool, and can only choose one starter, two-colour deck as a base at first. To expand your options you need to throw yourself against a wall of tough AI opponents with impeccable card draws (if I had a dollar for every time the AI had the perfect solution for my deck's bomb cards when I finally got them off, I'd be covered for the next Steam sale), or drop money on the card collections. This has already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off.  Unfortunately, there is a simple solution for this problem that could have been easily implemented: the middle ground. Give us the option to build decks on our own, but also allow us access to the types of prebuilt decks that the series has used all along (or at least more of the template decks you get to choose from). If my custom deck isn't suited for a particular challenge, let me switch to Jace's deck, or Elspeth's.  Aside from the deckbuilding, this game is great overall. The campaign continues last year's awesomeness, and this time the plot actually feels more relevant to the greater MTG storyline this time, with some sweet cutscenes as gravy. The achievements, personas, and titles offer a reasonable challenge to obtain, bringing a lot of replay value.   So in the end, my recommendation is complicated. Having played through on the iPad already, I can say this is one of the best games in the series despite its flaws, but really, it's just expanding on a the already-solid foundation. The deckbuilding option is divisive, though, and I have to say Duels 2014 is still the superior game.",1,0

3977478,311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"This game still has a long ways to go with regards to optimisation, as an i5 user i'll get 100% cpu usage with sometimes barely 40% gpu usage. I've set a cap of 59 fps because theres weird input lag if your fps is above or even below the refresh rate of your monitor.   I've been able to mostly keep the cap of 59 fps with a mix if high to medium settings, with some weird drops because of the rediculous cpu usage. The core gameplay content is enormous though and with modding support being added sometime in 2016, this game will have an infinite amount of content for countless hours of [zombies] gameplay. If you have a decent pc, I would recommend getting this now.  I've had 1 crash so far and 1 disconnect, that was due to treyarch and my other disconnect is due to my internet. If you have a mid range pc or mid to low with a 750 ti for example, I would say to wait a month or two until treyarch can push out a major performance patch.  It's a shame this game is plagued by performance issues as the core content is really great, I mean they made a whole zombies campaign that fans have been asking for since its inception with world at war. Theres gobblegums which add a nice dimension to zombies and weapon kits which is really cool.   I haven't played too much of campaign, but I'd hazard a guess that its your generic cod campaign with turret segments.  Multiplayer is fun, very quick.   TL;DR Content is there, performance wise its lacking. Only get it now if you have a beefy pc, otherwise refund and wait for patches to fix performance issues.",1,1

The first 40 minutes only gave me a pistol and a shotgun to work with, which was just plain boring especially since the shotgun had so little ammo to it and the pistol just felt like a peashooter.  I'm sure theres more to the game afterwards but the first part of the game just honestly made me sick of it, I was hoping for something more from this game from the start and it just fell flat on its face for me.

599815,204360,Castle Crashers,"  -Quick Review-   Castle Crashers is a side scrolling Beat 'em up developed by The Behemoth  (A developer I'm falling deeper in love with)  and released in 2012.      -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Castle Crashers takes place in a cartoon Middle Ages universe. The knights are sitting around a table eating a feast, but suddenly an evil wizard steals a large gem, and runs off with four princesses! Being a knight, it is your noble duty to save the princesses, the kingdom, and retrieve the stolen gem. Queue Adventure!  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507999966    Gameplay:  The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard.  (It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507997046  The controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item.  (you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks)  You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life. As you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.   Achievements:  There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game. There are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school. Alternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater!  link at bottom. :P    Price:  Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game  (unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?)  you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends.  (Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)    Conclusion:  Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative  (bonus points)  and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale. All in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507994483    More from The Behemoth  If you want to see my review for BattleBlock Theater,   click here!

When we try to analyze something, are we just projecting our own biases onto it? These are tall, open-ended questions that The Beginner's Guide tries to answer. What you get out of it, like most things in life, depends on you.  The game opens with Davey Wreden introducing himself as the writer of The Stanley Parable, a work he proudly calls 'absurd'. This game, he says, will be different. Delivering on that promise, The Beginner's Guide asks you not to make a series of choices, but to try and understand where a person was coming from as he created a series of video games. Wreden lets you play these games, frequently interjecting to give you his opinion on what everything means, but what really matters is what you take from the experience.   Traditional gameplay elements are sparse and accusations of being a 'waking simulator' will probably appear in droves, but that shouldn't impede players interested in the process of making and understanding games.

3979371,311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Black Ops 3: Multiplayer review  Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is a sci-fi multiplayer shooter that mainly revolves around you using a gun to shoot people. The Exoskeleton from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (sort of) returns, with your exo forgoing the traditional Exo Dash and Exo Jump to become a jetpack. New to the series is the ability to run on flat walls, allowing you to traverse the maps quicker and easier, along with the ability to swim underwater and shoot while under the water, giving the maps 2 more ways to traverse them.  The tried-and-true multiplayer modes return again, such as Team Deathmatch and Domination. Also from Advanced Warfare Uplink returns, and the all-new gamemode Safeguard has been implemented. The create-a-class system forgoes Advanced Warfare's 'pick 12' system, and Black Ops 3 uses a more traditional 'Pick 10' system. To further your customization, the all-new Specialist system lets you choose an additional Specialist Weapon or a Specialist Ability. You can choose either the weapon or the ability.  These special skills are timer-based, with kills accelerating the timer. Different modes will either speed up the time it takes, or make you wait longer. All of the Specialists operate under different call signs, and they all have their own unique personalities. They even talk to eachother. You can unlock additional customization options for them by completing challenges.  Scorestreaks return from advanced warfare, with you collecting points until you unlock them. [Protip: Press 1 and 2 to cycle through them when you have multiple available.] Unlike advanced warfare, the score streak selection is separate from Create-A-Class.  The maps range from being extremely small to being medium-sized, with plenty of walls to run and water to swim in. In the  lobby, you can vote for which map you want to play from a choice of 2 (and 1 random one).",1,0

He finds out Gordon, Barry, and Kliener have been imprisoned behind locked doors, and you eventually free all of them. After you free each one, you can play as that person, and take advantage of each of their special abilities to get all the Power Stars. After that, you must beat Dr. Breen and restore peace to the land once again.  Graphics 10/10 The graphics have been upgraded since the days of the N64. The characters are less blocky now, most notably Dr. Breen. He looks awesome now. And the intro is too great to be expressed in words. The file select screen has 5 things apparently floating on water (3 files, options, and Return to Mode Select). Whenever you touch the screen, the point you touched emits a ripple in the water. If you drag your stylus (or whatever) across the screen, ripples emit from every point touched. I stare in amazement every time I do this, especially considering this is on a portable.  Control 9/10 The controls in this game are great. You can do the whole mainstream game (not including minigames) with the buttons, except for loading and saving your game. The buttons are well laid out, but the running is a little awkward. You walk normally if you simply press a direction on the D-Pad, but you have to hold a button down to run. This isn't a big gripe until your thumb starts to get sore from the holding the button down. ut that's the only complaint I have.  Sound 9/10 No complaints here. The sound are fitting, the music is appropriate, and the voices (which are mostly grunts and yells and such) are clear and loud. Some of the music is not particularly catchy, but that's the only thing that kept Sound from getting 10/10.  Gameplay 10/10 I would have given it higher if I could have. If you've ever played the original Half Life 2, you'd know how sweet it was. Now think of it with a crapload of minigames (all of which are not only fun, but challenging), 30 more Stars to collect (bringing the total to 150), and the ability to play as 4 different characters, each with special abilities that are put to use in the levels and the castle. Gaming perfection? I think so.   Replay Value 10/10 With 150 Stars, a bunch of minigames, 4 playable characters, and the addition of a wireless multiplayer mode, you'll be playing Garry's Mod for long after you beat it.  Overall 10/10 This game was a huge leap up from the original Half Life 2, which was already sweet to begin with. If you have a DS, buy this game now. If you don't have a DS, buy one, if only just for this. If you can't afford a DS and/or this game, well that just sucks for you. Play a friend's if you have to. Then again, you might get hooked, so that may be a bad idea.",1,0

Really all that micropayement adding was a joke that almost kick all the vets out, come on new sheeps come and try...

And tbh this is really a good thing.  #2 : The weapons balance is really better, lot's of forgotten stuff will be back in our lobbyes due to that balance and new perks.  Cons : #3 Games now easier than ever for vets, and so for the new heisters, who'll never smell the fear we had when DW cames out first place.  #4 About the perk balance, yes dodge needed a nerf, be to me not a casualies so the crouch dodge bonus nerf was indeed a mistake, because it's a gameplay killer.

On the face of it, this is a Civ game, but it is very minimalistic - in terms of everything it has to offer - and you get the feeling they are going to flesh it all out with amazing DLC that costs half the price of the game,  The affinities are nice but there is no Civ diversity beyond that! For all those nice Civ-Only units have gone, to be replaced by affinity-gained units, which makes everybody you play against feel... samey.  Stations may as well not exist. I have no reason to use them at all. Same goes for orbital units - beyond removing the miasma, there is really no need to build them.  Challenge wise, the AI is lacking. I have had war declared on me and they havent even bothered to show up to attack me. Also, I dont know if its just the games I play in, but the AI never seem to improve their tiles...  I havent found nukes yet or ever some sort of Deus Ex Machina weaponary that makes them all tremble with fear.  The aliens come in two categories: Animals and Tile Fillers.

3910317,305640,Shattered Planet,"This game isn't a masterpiece, but if you look for certain things you'll find them here. So, what can you expect?   Solid content, everything works and is nicely crafted.   Roguelike approach: you send clones to explore planets knowing they’ll horribly die, but on death you’ll lose only your items, not your coins, and you’re allowed to spend them in between runs to permanently improve your stats and skill and buy new items, so death isn’t too punitive, and the game can be hard, but never frustrating.   Different kind of clones for different classes, you can switch between them during game and permanently power them up, this makes the game pretty grindy (rogue legacy like). I like it, but someone could not.   Potions’ effects are randomized at the start of every run, so you have to try them to know what they do, and there are a lot of items with active or passive effects.   Random events.   Destructible terrain tiles, but only if you have certain items, I think this should have been a core mechanic, the game could have been a lot better.   Exploration and discoveries, everything you do is rewarded, you unlock data for new terrain types, enemies, items, events, and every 10 new ones you get a reward.   Elemental damage and resistances, so you can combo them on your equipment and items to unleash a hell you are immune to.   Humor.   Conclusions:",1,1

2133908,238430,Contagion,"New review since the game just released from the Early Access stage. Immediately had to reset to dafault keys and it seems to be an okay game. It's more serious than L4D as the game has no specialized zombies like a tank or witch, just traditional zombies. Players can also play as zombies after dying as a human, so it has a bit of Zombie Panic and No More Room in Hell mixed in together. Considering part of the Zombie Panic team also worked on No More Room in Hell, this game really does resemble a bit of both. The game offers a fair amount of modes, objective mode is fairly complicated and easy to get lost in. Extraction mode I didn't particularly like since you're acting as rescuers. A bit strange of a goal especially when the NPC's follow you around like clueless morons with no survival skills. That's the job of the military usually, to rescue survivors, not you because you're too busy trying to survive on your own. You'd think the NPC survivors would also be trying to save their own hide. So it offers a new gameplay mechanic that Nmrih and Zombie Panic doesn't offer, but it's not the best mechanic either. Cellphone replaces the compass function you'd normally have in Nmrih and unlike Nmrih the players can still play after dying so a bit of Zombie Panic.  The good news is the game is less spatially disorientating than what it was in the past, so I give it a thumbs up for improving the camera movements of the game. The zombie running animation with the claws running out furiously could use some work, but aside from that, overall it's a mediocre game. I suggest buying this cheap and not at the full price ($19.99) it is currently at. You can have more fun with the free Zombie Panic and No More Room in Hell mods.",1,0
4661886,359320,Elite Dangerous,"It's important to note that this is a pretty hard game to get into. If you're not going to take the time to tweak your controls, learn the basics, watch a bunch of tutorials, read through the news and lore from within the game, you'll probably play a few hours then call quits.   However, for those that take the time to do the above will be rewarded with a very rich and rewarding experience.   Everything is complicated enough that once you get good at it, it's exciting. Landing your ship in a station can be quite an adventure at times. Running away from a bunch of pirates while you can see a clear crack on your winshield is quite stressful... warping is simply fantastic while combat requires a fair amount of practice and tactics.   For those that are wondering. This game is quite playable with a 360/PS3 controller or mouse/keyboard. I tried a few methods and found that mouse and keyboard really worked well for me. It did take me a few hours to tweak the settings and test out various adjustements but once I was done, the ship reacts exactly how I want it.   For any space sim fans, this is a must play.",1,0

5848930,49600,Beat Hazard,"If you're searching for a rhythm game which at least somehow relates to the music you play to (in comparison to some other games *cough*), Beat Hazard is in my opinion the way to go. Along with the currently available DLC's, it adds up to a versatile casual game you can enjoy your music to (Or smack kitties with your keyboard if you try to get all of the achievements/perks/unlocks/whatever).  GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is rather simple. It's Asteroids with the pace of the game adjusting to the pace of the music you chose. This could be local music or online radio streams (Great Addition, but restricted to the Ultra DLC). There is a little annoying bug which sometimes made my game not play any music anymore when i was playing to radio stations though. Give the game a restart and it was gone. Still annoying. The game also encourages you to play on until you got'em all. Perks, Upgrades (Beat Hazard Ultra DLC) and Ships (Shadow Operations DLC). If you're a completionist, that is. There is no specific reason to get all the unlocks after all.  I'd give it a 8,5/10 because of the annoying radio bug (maybe only appearing to me) and the replay value (40 hours for few bucks is quite okay i guess).  HOWEVER if you want to enjoy the game to the full potential i would really recommend getting the DLCs as well. It adds up to the game experience greatly as for new, different ships, online radio support, more enemies, more bosses, more modes and so on.",1,0

4812764,369060,Amygdala,"Disclaimer: I was given a key to this game from the developer.  If this game were in early access (and it should be) I would give it a passing grade. To consider this a final product is a bit short-sighted, and it's not nearly worth $10. Don't get me wrong, I've had a bit of fun with this game. I was actually going to recommend this game until something happened.  I beat the first level. I finally got past the clunky, loose controls and beat the first level. I managed to find the wizard (the boss who I had never found before) and kill him. Then a portal appeared and I got excited to see what came next.  The title screen. The title screen is what came next. Am I missing something? Was that IT? Imagine playing Risk of Rain but having no items and nothing past the first level. Just the first level over and over again. According to another reviewer you can unlock hats, so that's... something. It supposedly gets more difficult every time you beat it, but that only adds so much replayability, it's more important that the game is enjoyable. Doing the same 'meh' gameplay over and over again just doesn't do it for me.  This game does have some good things going for it.    The story is cute, clever and imaginative. It threw me into the world with childlike wonder.    The voice acting is very good.    The graphic style is very enjoyable to me. It perfectly carries the whimsical feel of the story.    The sound effects are well done but can feel out of place at times.    The music is good but sounds like it belongs in a mystery/spy game.    Pooping bricks is a fun mechanic, though doesn't really make sense.   Other issues I had. (In addition to things I listed above)    Menu system is basic and severely lacking. If you're only going to give us left and right, make the menus left and right.    There is no HUD at all. You never know how much health you have or how much damage each creature does. Some are a one hit kill, others aren't.    You're given no instructions (this was apparently a conscious decision by the dev who expects you to go to their website to learn how to play the game) and don't really understand what your goal is until you find it. You're also picking up green gems for some reason. Points? The cryptic help screen left me with more questions than answers.    Any difficulty the game has is purely based on it being difficult to control, not on enemy design. The wizards are the only enemy that adds anything substantial to the combat to make it interesting.  As it's described in the game's description. 'We've put in the bare minimum amount of tutorials and help to make people stop complaining.' Who is complaining about being told the basic mechanics of the game?   In the end, this feels like the type of thing I would create if I had the time to learn how to develop a game. I would be proud of it, but I wouldn't think it's worth $10. I probably wouldn't even release it. I would take what I learned and start working on the next project.

The worms themselves allow for customization, which would make you believe that you have more control whereas you in fact have less. The quasi 3D enviroment is no match for the old-school bitmap like maps, making it hard to judge where you can stand/walk/jump, and distracting from the game play. The weapons still work in the same way, but the controls are all over the place and judging wind and compensating for new stuff such as water (and whether it will flow or not) is frustrating. The single player campains later on require you to get every shot and movement correct, with little to no margin for error (made more difficult by the graphics).   It is not the worst worms-game I have played (worms: a space oddity for the wii takes that spot), but if you want a blast from the past, I'd suggest going for the versions released for android rather than this.",-1,0

Instead of copy pasting the same ♥♥♥♥ every year and pretending it's a whole new game, why not actually make SEQUELS, proper 2 or 3 or 4 year development cycle sequels that noticably raise and develop the concept, and database updates, editor, manager Barbie mode, maybe official licenses and even face and stadium packs, anything that does not affect the players ability to manage a team, could be sold as fairly priced DLC packs to pay the bills. But you'll never get it, you're too far gone.  I played this series many years ago, when it was on the Amiga and early PC versions, but the game lost it's magic for me, they forgot that less is more, it's far better to do a few things well rather than trying to do everything to varying degrees of success, from the sublime to the comically, excrutiatingly ridiculous.  It's not only me, look at the reviews, sure some justifiably angry 'lied to' Chinese have skewed the figures, but only slightly, look at the top rated reviews, all negative and not a chinese character in sight.

You should ditch the 3D match engine for a start, go back to basics, leave what is good, improve what can be improved and throw the rest into the trash, then slowly add new features once they are functioning correctly.  Sega killed this franchise, like they did with Total War, it's dying a horrible and humiliating death, most can see it, sure it still sells and will always sell as long as it's the only show in town, but wait, mark my words, one day some football loving genius will emerge from his bedroom with the game this one should have become after 20 odd years of trying, a market conqueror that will emerge and kick this stale over-hyped garbage into touch once and for all.

Bland combat, too many automatic weapons, small bland maps, AoE orbital super attacks, vehicles require ingame credits, blatant OP weapons, ignored broken mechanics, out of place 'class' system., and now complete developer abandonment.  They didn't have to copy Tribes 2 word for word, but they probably shouldn't have built it with nothing but broader appeal, and over simplification.

Ingredients: 1) 2 cups Flour 2) 1/2 cup Sugar 3) 1/4 teaspoon Salt 4) 2 sticks (1 Cup) Salted Butter, Cut Into Small Cubes 5) Filling 6) 1-1/2 cup Sugar 7) 1/4 cup Flour 8) 4 whole Large Eggs 9) Zest And Juice Of 4 Medium-sized Lemons 10) Powdered Sugar, For Sifting  Directions:  1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.  2. Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours, then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)",1,1

5866789,498970,,Well this is a first person shooter with odd enemies that don't seem to fit the environment. The game is hard for me to play and I am not sure why exactly. Yes I know that is weird too. The graphics are good and the enemies seem like they don't get hurt enough and the bullets don't seem effective when they seem like they should be. I have mixed feelings about this game that is for sure. It is average but I think it could have been a lot better if the devlopers did not make it a wave shooter feeling of a game. It is free roam and you can dodge the enemies sort of although there is not much room when in corridors. Cover fire fights would have made this game an A+ but the devs wanted a brainless wave shooter feel to it with free-roaming. It does have many levels so that is a plus. My final conclusion would be if you like wave shooters with free roam and some heavy difficulty then buy this. It is not a wave shooter in a classic sense as you can reach the end of each level then move to the next so it does change as you go. I am going to recommend this but only on a fine line since the price is low compared to some other titles out there and it does feel a little clunky to play with the guns. Nothing you can get used to I am sure.,1,0

5274469,400160,Concrete Jungle,"What seems to be the most pertinent question about Concrete Jungle is whether it is in fact a city-building game? If your definition equates to constructing various types of building and having to consider their placement due to effecting factors like the economy and technology levels, then yes it is a city-builder! Is it in the same ilk as something like Sim City? No.  I’d personally slate Concrete Jungle down as a puzzle game primarily. One that looks fairly simplistic in nature due to its colourful and clear-cut appearance, but spend a few hours in the game and the complexities reveal themselves pretty fast. The game requires a constant level of concentration, planning moves ahead, saving certain buildings or certain tiles to be used later, at the most efficient time.  There are various game modes but the main objective in all modes is to clear columns of your “city”. This is done in single-player mode by reaching a column target that will increase as the game progresses. Playing versus the AI you will have to beat your opponent’s column score to claim your column points and their column points too. If neither you nor the AI reach the column target you both collect your individually accrued points total.  Playing versus the AI is a wonderful piece of game design, it is so suited for playing against a human opponent. Sadly this is reserved only to be played locally in hot seat fashion. The developer has stated that online multiplayer will not be added. This is really sad as the potential fun for playing online is huge.  The buildings at your disposal are distributed via a card system of which there are currently two hundred and five individual cards! They are separated into six different tiers of cards and vary in how powerful they are. Part of the strategy of the game is to influence your deck to your advantage, replacing less useful cards with more powerful cards. There is a lot to consider and keep track on.  I played through the campaign which maybe took 25 hours or so to get three stars in each level. I was anticipating after finishing the campaign that the game might go stale without having any multiplayer mode but the game includes leaderboards and the fun continues trying to improve your own score and chase others higher up in the rankings.  I find it very difficult to fault Concrete Jungle in any way. Even the OST fits perfectly and the voice acting is equally charming!  I can wholeheartedly recommend Concrete Jungle especially to those that enjoy a puzzle game that demands focus and requires concentration to be successful.",1,1

2013132,23490,Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition,"Ok first of all, I like this game. It is rather good. There is nothing wrong with it in a sense of quality and features...It's just...It's kind of dry. I can't quite put my finger on it. But all I know is that I don't enjoy my time playing this. It's just bland. Here's a good way to put it. It's like a rice cake. Very dry and no flavor. But this is a special rice cake, it has that extremely sweet white frosting dazzled on the top of it. So in a way it's good, but it's still a rice cake. See what I'm getting at. Also the game is sold as a city builder, but I'm not feeling that strategy side that all city builders are supposed to have. It's to easy to win this game. Also there are no real penalties to the bad decisions you make in the game. So again, it's a rice cake.   Now I'm jumping to the things that I really just don't like about the game. So no more rice metaphors. First of all the road building.....Oh my sweet goodness me. It is supremely dimwitted. It just doesn't listen to what I want it to do! I try to do grids, I get squiggles. I want to do squiggles, I get a grid. It's just bad. Another thing, the builders.............JUST BUILD THE FRIKKIN FARM! IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS! JUST BUILD IT! It gives you an option to speed up the building process by prioritizing the things you want done. But all that does is gets one builders attention for 3 seconds. So everything you want to get built, doesn't get built and everyone gets angry, and you lose....*sigh*  There's another thing. Stop telling me to build garages! I have enough! And lastly. The radio......... I want to tie up Juanito, set him in a boat....made of meat, drench the entire thing in gasoline, shove it toward a shark with a match strapped to it's nose, and then do the same thing to his set of records that consist of only 5 songs. I hate Juanito!...........RICE CAKE! (I lied)  Ok now that my anger has been taken out. Let me tell you what you need to do if you want to build a city in a video game and pretend your a crazed dictator from South America.........Buy Cities: Skylines, and use your imagination.

Though it must be said that this game is more 'hide &amp; seek' (well, mostly just the 'hide' part) than it is 'run &amp; gun'. If you like your horror games with more action and gunplay, then you should probably just check out Dead Space...Alien: Isolation will rarely have you using guns. I was probably about 3 hours in before I fired a single shot. Don't let that fool you though, this game is intense! The design of the environments will draw you into the world thanks to the excellent graphics and superb sound design (do yourself a favor and only play this with headphones on). The A.I. is fantastic and greatly adds to the experience, though the enemy types are somewhat limited, the lack of variation does not detract from the overall experience. My only complaint is that some sections are pretty difficult, and will likely require multiple tries to complete but the game only allows saving by checkpoints, so sometimes you have to repeat an easy or tedious section just to get back to the difficult part. However, any other save system would detract from the overall experience if one could just constantly save the game.  If you like horror/survival this game is a must-buy!",1,0

1153582,218620,PAYDAY 2,"TL;DR Move over EA, there's a new DLC ♥♥♥♥♥ in town. And they even do movie deals!  I saw the game is on sale and I decided to come back and revise my review to meet what I currently think... I would no longer recomend this game. I used to love this game and I played it almost daily but I don't play it at all anymore. It's still buggy as hell and I doubt that will change anytime soon. There are now 20ish DLCs. The first DLCs included quite a bit for their price, often multiple levels and multiple weapons. Now it's like a weapon reskin and one level and priced at the same price... They also advertised for a movie by having the character from the movie join the game and had a month long countdown posted in the forums that turned out to be advertising for some stupid Walking Dead game. I no longer feel like Overkill cares about the game, they just care about the money. You can only play each heist so many times before it gets boring and since I don't want to pay $5 (I can get a whole game for that in a sale...) for each new level that I will play 10 times and get bored of I am pretty much done with this game.   Old review:  This game is pretty buggy for having been out so long, I hear it's practically unplayable on console still. It is quite fun though so I'd say it's worth playing.

First, you have to buy a character, then you fight other people in an attempt to get a ranking to get money in order to get gear for that character so you can get MORE money for more costumes, gear, characters, pots, etc... It's not uber shabby or anything, but it's definitely not worth your time if you like both pvp and pve. Just refer to Tea Time Sensei's review. It's quite accurate. I honestly don't know if i would recommend this game just because it's not my cup of tea... I can definitely see where they were trying to go with it, but a lot of the skills are too ridiculous, (the robots and the gunner sniping skill,) and the movement mechanism is a bit odd for me. My suggestion to the ones who created this is to allow people to teleport out of the homing attack. What's the point of the teleport if the game is just going to auto track you?",-1,0

2735370,252410,SteamWorld Dig,"I bought this on a whim during the Holiday 2013 sales. I am so incredibly glad I did. I had heard of this title by name only but I really knew nothing about it. It had a nice enough aesthetic from the trailer/screens but it wasn't until I played it that it all made sense and the whole package took me along for the ride.  There isn't a deep story but there is a deep mine. You dig, dig, and dig some more; every action a permanent one. I heard that the mines are actually randomly generated (at least the non-challenge room parts) and that's exciting to know I wont find myself making similar paths next time. I have heard this game described as Dig Dug meets Super Metroid. Honestly, while I have never really played Dig Dug, I can assure you this is loaded with Metroid-style upgrades. You earn them by collecting gold via gems.  I loved the experience of hunting for every possible gem. I think I found them all too. I completed the game with over $23,000 gold and 193 orbs. This earned me the Steam achievements related to it but also shows just how much there is to grab. Once you start excavating you'll understand how large those numbers are. Each upgrade to the character made sense and I really enjoyed discovering them.  I could keep on talking I suppose but I think it's better for people to just experience it.  If you enjoy collecting items in Banjo-Kazooie... but with a more methodological approach like a puzzle game... and utilizing a progression/upgrade system similar to the Metroid series... as well as classic and easy to handle platforming... then you'll enjoy this game. I completed it in just under nine hours according to the game clock.  I highly recommend it. Highly. Yay for it being on Mac too! I absolutely hope there's a sequel that is both on 3DS and the Mac. I might buy it on both platforms.",1,0

To keep this short, COH1 just had the right control and features, with graphics and effects to go with, whereas COH2 just feels like a remake with some very buggy placements.  The online Lag can be a killer with people getting more lag than COH1, my and my friends have 50MB/s Fibre lines, downloading at around 5MBs and still get extreme lag throughout.  I'm still a huge fan of COH1 and a little dissapointed with this new release. The added feature of creating maps and sharing them without the need t odownload any or upload them is fantastic.   I would still recommend this game as with the added maps from the COH2 Community this game makes it a worth while playable online game. If you're looking to play the bog standard online and not be involved in the community you may be very dissapointed.  More online features are needed, with the COH1 (Multiplayed defence) matches, COH1 just ruled, and still does today.  Still recommend it as a fan of the franchise, but if you're looking to play online with friend go straight back to COH1 (less lag, more options, better game play, more game modes)....",1,0

I thought, however, a remaster would be more on par with Fable others like Fable anniversary. This is hardly a remaster; its like anti-aliasing added on and a few other additional options. While bioshock is amazing; it feels like they litterally did a day of work and stamped 'REMASTER' on the title. It even comes with the same glitches and bugs (in my case, sound quality and video boxing during bathy sphere sequence).  I am only content with getting this due to it being free; if you own the orginal bioshock on another DRM, I would recommend talking to tech support for a steam key for this; its not worth the additional money to buy.  I am only going to recommend buying this remaster for first time bioshock players.",1,0

Regarding the game: After the great success of Walking Simulator 2012 - aka Dear Esther - The Chinese Room decided to create a new gameplay experience called Sneak Simulator 2015 - aka Everybody's Gone (pardon: sneaked) to the Rapture.  Enough sarcasm:  Pro:  + Great visuals + Stunning soundtrack  + Good story + Movement speed can be modified using CheatEngine  Cons: - Movement speed beyond good and evil (it's just too slow) - Weird usage of the stunning soundtrack (the scene for 'Carry me back to her Arms' was way too disappointing) - Unsatisfying end  So would I recommend buying this game?   Yes and no. 10 € is too much, I'd rather recommend to buy it for about 5 € (or USD) - if you haven't got the soundtrack, simply buy it on Amazon.

1913672,233130,Shadow Warrior,"Shadow Warrior is jam-packed with epic fighting moves and fantastical powers, but you'll always find yourself being challenged. After the opening section of the game, weaker foes will fall before you with ease, but their tougher comrades aren't going to let you off the hook. However, this can be both a blessing and a curse.  Constantly challenging enemies serve an important purpose in gaming: they keep the difficulty from dropping so low that the game ceases to be interesting. At the same time, however, this can lead you as a player to feel like you're never improving as you progress. Shadow Warrior unfortunately falls into this category from time to time. New sword techniques will always look and feel impressive when you first learn them, but eventually it will start to seem as though your enemies are shrugging them off with little effort.  Similarly, the gun combat sometimes feels downright neglected compared to the swordplay. There are weapon upgrades and a few relevant skills, but the absence of anything resembling gun-kata makes firearms feel like somewhat overgrown support tools rather than their own beasts.  Despite the above criticism, however, Shadow Warrior is still a greatly entertaining experience. Although the guns aren't as interesting as the sword, few games allow you to slice and shoot quite as fluidly as this one.",1,0

There are a lot of gamebreaking bugs that sneak in with every release, the game has a tendency to crash a lot with no real reason, and there is definitely function that could and probably should be added within the future such as more custom house rules or the ability to use characters from an expansion without using the whole expansion.  That being said, I still like the game a lot. I would say it has the potential to be a lot better and while I do understand that the developers aren't a big group it doesn't mean it has to show.

4904650,377530,侠客风云传(Tale of Wuxia),"Pros: + A game that does not hold your hand and tells you where to go. It expects you to explore and fail + I'm just at the surface of all the features of the game (after 20 hours) + For wuxia lovers, a definite try (especially since it's in English) + Many amusing/annoying minigames to simulate mining, smithing, herb gathering etc (the treasure chest puzzle with 4 colours and 20 moves? insane) + The only game so far I know where every NPC has a name or a unique title, and between them they never say the same things. Sometimes, talking to an NPC will trigger a quest or even a small minigame (usually a riddle) + The translation is quite acceptable (if you are a reader of wuxia light novels translated to english, it feels similar). Humourous at times, poetic at others.   Cons: + I hate the music, or it's just me. If they took the soundtrack from Prince of Qin it would be so much better. (FHXY : PLEASE TAKE NOTE!!!!!) + You really need to know a lot about wuxia (internal arts, battle style, meridian systems, chinese poetry etc) to make heads or tails of it. I can guess it will be very difficult for people who has little knowledge or appreciation of wuxia.  + Potential to really screw up your character build if you have no idea what you are doing. Too many stats (though it will be explained to you slowly over the course of 10 to 20 hours of gameplay) + Translation bugs (a few npc did not have complete translation. So unless you can read chinese, either get someone who can to help you, or just spray and pray). As mentioned by some other reviewers, some description for people/items are not complete as it got cut off. (if some items can have its font minimized to fit into the description box, why not others. Don't be lazy, developers)  Advice for players + Google is your friend (barely) + The meridian system translation will be found in your character sheet - books - medicine. Then take a picture of each meridian point (cheat...lol). you will ace every medicine task (crucial to access pellet making ie potion making. Pellets and potions are very expensive at game start, and few and far. Some pellets/potions provide permanent boosts to your attribute, so swig em.) + Many of the poetry and sayings mentioned are directly translated from Mandarin (that's why it sounds so exotic/ridiculous depending on your POV)....pay attention when they are bolded or different colour (usually an indication a minigame or riddle will come up) + you will start really really weak, compared to other games where you start able to hack and kill normal mobs. IF you cannot win, try to keep your (personal) character from dying. Use the experts that the game usually include for you to weaken or kill the enemies. In due course, you will grow. The game letting you use other experts with other weapons and internal styles is to give you a picture of what your character can potentially learn and become (yes, there is a son goku style kamehameha move somewhere in there) + don't bother to master all the production /crafting skills - personally i went with mining/smithing/medicine/music. You won't have time to max them at the start (im not sure about end game...barely there) + the more internal skills you obtain and upgrade (even if you don't equip them) the higher your hp and energy will go + a lot of the food/tea/wine/consumable stuff provides permanent boosts to hp and energy. if you have the cash, buy em and eat. No point to store em. + Sometimes the game will proceed when you haven't finish a particular quest. Deal with it, it's mostly gone.  + I had 2 crashes. Once when fiddling with the graphics setting, another when during gameplay. I cannot comment on the persistent crashes other people are facing, and have no idea. Try to play on lowest graphical setting + talk to everyone and everything. You never know. Explore each and every map. It's not that big. Buildings can be entered, you will notice a faint golden glow at the entrance, or the doors will open up. + safe the game before opening any treasure chest (until you can recognize which one does not require a puzzle to be solved, and which one does) treasure chest keys are not easily obtainable + some minigames (for crafting/production) will frustrate you to the max. Take it easy.  With the lack of quality wuxia genre games in Steam and most importantly in English, this game however is quite a rough gem. Certain facets of it is brilliant, while other parts are rough and coarse. It is hoped the developers or publishers of this game take this into account and do something to polish up the rough and coarse parts. There has never been a quality wuxia genre game in English (AFAIK, prince of qin nearly 15 years ago pretty good, but not great), and wuxia mmo has been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since day one. Hopefully with Tale of Wuxia (and official patches and upgrades) a new genre will enter the gaming sphere.",1,1

I set all the settings to the lowest settings, and any fast travel and starting up the game took upwards of 45 seconds (this is on my computer which can run almost any game at max settings with few problems). When I set the settings to max, I had load times of sometimes two minutes when booting up the game. Although with this said, performance in game is actually quite good.   2. In past fallout titles, you had the ability to have many options when in conversations (I especially enjoyed this in Fallout NV), however in this game, you never have more than 4 options. They are ussually limited to Yes, sarcastic yes, no, and sometimes a persuade option. This makes the options very limited, and makes you feel like your choices aren't impacting the game.

3185682,268500,XCOM 2,"The game initially showed promise, but I quickly came to realise that it's so tied up in the designers' decisions for showboating and 'what-would-be-awesomes' that it isn't actually any  fun  to play.  The core of the original XCOM game is there and they've added some really solid new features to it, such as the armour system and melee combat, but the bad decisions significantly outweigh the good. The amount of RNG (which on it's own is fine), combined with new status effects that essentially render your soldiers completely ineffective for a turn (and the sheer number the enemy can deploy them on you) can quickly render entire missions impossible to complete within the first turn of combat, potentially forcing you to reload the same mission over and over.   Animations in combat take forever and sometimes pause for a second or two afterwards for no clear reason, completely removing the sharp and snappy combat aesthetic they were aiming for and making battles take forever. The camera seems to snap all over the place for no good reason, even occassionally missing important enemy moves, and if I have to see that pointing animation one more time I don't know what I'll do.  The stealth system, while a nice addition, seems a bit ad-hoc and doesn't seem to explore its own potential fully. I'm not sure how I'd change it up but currently it just feels lacking.  The additions to the overworld gameplay are really fun and add a lot to the game, the more guerilla style warfare gives XCOM 2 a suitably refreshing style change from 1 and I think it's the overworld that's the strongest part of the game. However, that doesn't really translate to the battle gameplay.  Additionally, I'll be the first to admit my machine isn't top of the line (or even all that good anymore) but the amount of variation in the framerate, even with graphics settings dialled down from recommended only increase the frustration of trying to play this further.  In conclusion, a promising game sorely let down by some terrible design decisions for the battle system that would turn an otherwise fun game into a mess of frustration and disappointment. A real shame, as XCOM 1 is among my higher rated games.",-1,0
2289109,241600,Rogue Legacy,"Incredibly addictive 2D platformer with retro-style graphics, random levels and a great replay-factor. Every run of the game consists of a single life, where you make your way through a semi-randomly generated tower to hunt down a number of bosses. When you die, the world is wiped-clean (barring any bosses you've already slain) and you play your character's child - which is randomly generated from a number of entertaining traits. This makes it fun to pick your next child (you get a choice from 3 variations) - who might be a dwarf warrior, a giant mage, or an exceptionally strong rogue type.  While death is permanent, you get to spend your loot on permanent upgrades that give you a good sense of progression between runs. There are hundreds of incremental upgrades, so there is always something new to purchase and look forward to. However, you have to make sure you spend your gold before your next run, otherwise Charron will take his hefty share for letting you back into the tower. Each run typically lasts between 5 and 15 minutes, which means that it's a lot of fun to just pick up and play a few runs at any time and feel like you're making progress.  On the down-side, if you don't get hooked by the mechanics, I could see the game becomming a tad repetitive. You make your way through the same 4 regions of the tower over and over and while I found this a lot of fun, it's a little tedious given the fact that, before you buy the upgrades from dying 50 times, you are probably simply just not strong enough to take on certain bosses / regions.  Overall, this is an excellent game if you like retro-style platformers with a high-tension feel (think Ghouls and Ghosts on steroids). The graphics are colourful and fun, the audio seemed to fit and never felt out of place and, while a little on the repetitive side, the amount of variation in the characters you play, the abilities you get through the various classes and the spells you can cast - means you can easilly play this game for a few hours on end before realising the time that's slipped away!",1,0

4254840,326720,Instant Dungeon!,"A very fun pick-up-and-play title, I got sucked in easily. You have no abilities of your own, your interactions with the dungeon are entirely through the many items you'll find scattered around. Weapons can be thrown at enemies, scrolls offer various defensive, offensive, or beneficial effects, torches and keys do exactly what you think.  This is, simply put, the most adorable dungeon game ever. You pick from the roster of bubble-headed characters and are plopped into a tiny dungeon with happy music. Enemies present like cuddly stuffed animals and move about with silly little animations. Defeat an enemy with an item and it crumples to the floor with a dejected frowny face.  The first time I got killed by an enemy because I goofed up, I said 'Oh no!' and chuckled when I got sent back to the very beginning. Every time I lost thereafter was exactly the same. I run into a happy weretiger; I get run over by a smiling pumpkin; the happy boss guy blows me up; 'Oh no!', chuckle or laugh. The most annoyed I ever get is 'Eh, I shouldn't have done that.' Even losing itself is somehow fun. In no other game in my Library or collection would my reaction to death and losing all my progress be the same reaction that I would have to seeing a kitten get stuck in a cardboard tube.",1,0

1452901,221640,Super Hexagon,"This is my Review of Super Hexagon.!  Super Hexagon is a really fast pasted game, if you like very fasted pasted games that are indie's, this you would like then, but i wouldn't really recommend this, i just pressed yes for random, the reason why i wouldn't really recommend this is because.  When you are playing this game, you can use A,D or Left arrow key, right arrow key, or Left mouse click , right M click, but when you are using them keys you won't be as accurate or precise when you are playing the game, its also abit of a rage game at the same time. I think they could've made this game a lot better, by being able to use you're mouse, so instead of pressing keys, you can go in options, and enable your mouse, so all you'll have to do is move you're mouse to the side, and with that, you can be a lot of accurate and more precise to we're you are aiming your arrow to go. and also, from my opinion, Super Hexagon is a game all about your focus towards games, like.. without focus, you wouldn't be able to get far into this game, you will also need very good eye coordination, because of how fast this game is, you can move precisely were you would want to.  Reflexes, without good reflexes, you'd be dying in an instant, because this game is very fast pasted, so you will have to be ready for anything that runs into you're face, and smashing you to death. This game is very addictive when you start to get into it, so this game will be good to pass time if you are waiting for something, or something else xD  But if you do like games we're they build your reflexes, eye coordination this game would be a type for you... :'D i am not very good but i have just baught it myself.",1,0

4009301,311560,Assassin's Creed Rogue,"This is one of the best Assassin's Creed titles in existence. It's not like Unity where it's a very dragged out story just to make it seem like it was worth your money. I will be honest; when I first bought this game for $59.99 USD, I felt it was a tad bit overpriced. Felt like it should have $49.99 at the most, mainly because it is not as large as Assassin's Creed IV, but I got over it rather quick.  In this game you follow the path of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin living in the times shortly before Connor enters the scene, but well after Edward Kenway leaves the scene (and is long dead) while his son Haytham searches the Colonies for the Grand Temple. Shay is sent on a mission (these are spoilers but it happens within the first hour of the game, and is the base plot) to Lisbon, where he is to look at a Selsmic Piece of Eden, which is commonly just called a Seed of Eden or a Tree of Eden. These pieces of eden have the power, when removed from their place, to make whatever location is holding up to instantaneous collapse itself and self-destruct.   Shay journeys on this mission to Lisbon and heads underneath a temple in the Carmo Convent. Shay, unknowing of what the result would be, touches the SPOE, and unintentionally causes the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake/Tsunami Disaster, causing the city to fall on All Saints' Day. Shay, rightfully ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, heads back to his Assassin HQ to tell his mentor, Achilles Davenport (the mentor of Connor from AC3 who is younger now) what happened. Achilles does not listen and plans to go to the other three temples contain a SPOE.   And so, Shay goes  Rogue  from the Assassins, wanting to join the Templars and stop them from accidentally destroying more cities. This is the basic plot of the game, and in my opinion, one of the best. The entire story keeps me hooked and it ends perfectly, The game is roughly about 6 sequences, which is perfect. It was a short game but in a good way.   If you liked Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, IV, and somewhat III, this is perfect for you and makes up for the disappointing Unity.  I rate this game a 9/10, and think IGN's review is bologna. This is easily one of the best, if not the best story in the Assassin's Creed franchise.",1,0

I've put over 150 hours into the PS3 version, and now that it's finally made it's way to the PC I cannot recomend it enough. The original console releases were plagued by muddy graphics, ♥♥♥♥ framerate and 540p rendering with black bars on the top and bottom, but the PC port fixes this and any of the other techical problems present.  Everybody who likes RPGs, action games, or aught inbetween should pick this up. It's an amazing blend of genres on the gameplay side, and the presentation of everything else is top-notch. The story starts off a bit generic, but goes into overdrive after you slay a certian big red monster. Saying much more than that gets really spoilery, and when it hits it'll blow you away.",1,1

4693740,360170,How to Survive 2,"This is actually a pretty chill and relaxing game, which is what I was looking for: Something to smash things while I watch TV. The crafting system isn't a complex mishmash of crap like so many games have, due to the UI being pretty good. You can play it with a controller which is always a plus, especially if you have a Steam Link like me (for some odd reason).   I haven't gotten far, but it reminds me of an ARPG like Diablo but with just zombies, and i'm shocked i'm giving this a thumbs up because zombie games coming out on Steam are like beating a dead horse zombie.  There's a Twitch integration thing which I think let's people join up as zombies so they can harass you, but it's optional, so if you're in the mood to have people grief you while you play, you can do that. But you can also own them and mock them on your Twitch channel if you're into that.   I would say the only negative thing is that there is only one female playable model and I don't think there are female zombies, so they were pretty lazy with that. There isn't a lot of customization either. Just weird tattoo stuff that no one would have if a zombie apocalypse would happen.  Anywho, I recommend it, even though I wish the customization was more robust, because it would be nifty to make myself Michonne (Who better not be dead!!!) and kill zombies with bats and rakes.",1,1

A bit difficult but nothing too serious and game play was great.  Took my breath away when she dies, It feels so bad like ' WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE THIS??? ' or like ' TAKE ME INSTEAD!!! ' I love the puzzles and lore of the island. I like how they went for a prequel instead of a sequel the fact that she was badass from the very beginning just made me go 'wow'.

The graphics are very well polished, except in soome occasions you will see the most horrible plant textures. The game is Open World to some extent. You cannot explore the whole Islands until you progress the story, however you are left to explore the two Islands at your will once you beat the game. Although I loved the game I did hate one thing.

The gameplay shifts beautifly creating an enjoyable mix from intence firefights and quick re-tasking to constant engagement and wars of atrittion, or from the artilary computer to the rounds supporting forces in the AO. It is different from other shooters because of the interplayer dependence; for example, you have finished the objective, but your squad is pinned down in a building and you have extract on the way; it is up to your squad to supress the enemy and smoke around the LZ for the extract team, and it is up to the extract team to get to the AO while evading enemy fire, land, and extract the forces safely. Also, because of the editor, you have senerios in which a commander can be producing AI units and squads, like in an RTS, while player squads attack specific objectives at the same time.

If you get Shadow Warrior 2 my advice; play on one of the two higher difficulties, that way you move away from the weaker loot faster. Runs great on my old ♥♥♥ system. A crazy high damage low survivablity combat, with fast distance-covering dashing and jumping. Fantastic weapon handling, very impactful gunplay and shredding to a cathatic degree. Flying Wild Hog do ace shotguns. Every character is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, some more lovable than others. With even the straight man, Smith, throwing in the odd jabs. I like what Flying Wild Hog has done with the world design, a breaking world slowly being terraformed into a demonic landscape on floating islands, aswell as a cyberpunk-esque city scape, reminiscent of a slightly more futuristic Hard Reset (I see those cleaning bots and cement mixers *tap nose*). The fear of bullet sponge enemies was unwarranted. Still managing to shred hordes with my unmodded Shotgun and pistol 4 missions in at the same rate on Want some Wang difficulty. Added in some mods part way through mission 4 with a small difference to ammo conservation. Charged shoot, electric Shotgun sounded fun! Two small nitpicks: -Alot of invisible walls, which I wasn't expecting considering the badass jumping and air-dashing, on top of hiding secrets in the missions. -Melee weapons seem to be a focus, yet the Eximus type enemies that have elemental damage inflict continous damage when you get close. Modded a sword with damage resist and health back on kill doesn't make much of a difference.   SW2 is quite the melting pot of ideas. People are gravitating to the idea it's a Looter Shooter, Borderlands being the most commonly cited comparsion. Which makes me scratch my head, as it compares better to Warframe, expect you have access to equiping weapons and mods during a mission... and being first person (obviously). -Hub Based - Players return to a 'home' instance, accept missions from other characters and travel to their mission instanced locations. -Weapons aren't disposable - You're not selling and equiping weapons the same way as an ARPG. Weapons are clearly defined bases, with specific functionality and statistics. You're not dropping a shotgun for the same visual but differently stat'ed shotgun with higher damage calculated based on item level and rarity. -Weapon/Armour modding - SW2 more closely goes for mod cards which are looted and applied to the weapons, armour and spirit/spells of your choice. Altering existing stats as well as adding or deminishing new effects, such as charged shoot, dual weilding, rapid fire. These gems are what get the calculator treatment, based on item level and rarity.",1,0

3215317,269650,Dex,"Dex is overflowing with cyberpunk, which is a good thing if you like the genre. It's not a great game by any means, and I encountered few bugs here and there - nothing gamebreaking though - but it is a great fun for someone who loved Neuromancer. It is similar to Shadowrun Returns, the difference is its 2d presentation and more action oriented combat. The atmosphere is very similar, but as I prefer my cyberpunk unmagical Dex was a wee bit better for me. All in all if you like cyberpunk definetely give it a try. Game is not that long, took me ca. 11 hrs with almost all the sidequests done, but it was fun 11 hrs. Recommended.  Pros: * cyberpunk! * nice presentation * interesting story  Cons: * simple combat * gunfight controls are meh * itemization is lacking (basically you have ammo, healing items and trash)",1,0

You just fly around, but use the power of your friends to combat and traverse portions of the environment. They're easy to use and control and have clearly defined roles. Problem is that you have little time where you are using all three at once. There are a couple sections that felt out of place like the cannon flight, but they're few and far between. My only other gripe is that the game really gives you zero context for how an enemy is defeated or a section traversed. It's all trial and error.   Visuals are peak retro. They use the term hi-bit and I like it for this genre of graphics. I really liked the character animations. Otus's surprised face gave me a giggle every time.   Well worth the asking price.",1,0

357620,15120,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2,"One of the best tactical shooters ever made. It's aged but still the most fun on co op. Most games don't even come close to the intense and fun shootouts still to this day. I am sure now that Ubisoft has gone super mainstream, as in, every game has to be call of duty for them, we won't see another like this. It is unfortunate, but I guess that's what game companies want.   Get your friends and play this shooter, after you have gone through the story mode, do the terrorist hunts. There is no better FPS tactical shooter on the market you can do this with. The controls handle very well, and this game is very challenging where you mostly get one shot. Sometimes two... but you better get your kill!  The only thing I don't like is sometimes the AI is pretty kamikaze with no consideration for their own life. They just run in your face to cheapshot you. Kind of ridiculous since you are holding cover aware of your own life, the AI is not and could care less if it dies to get you. Doesn't make sense for someone trying to do what is being told in this story, but most firefights are pretty intense.   Enjoy it and have fun!",1,0

822656,209670,Cortex Command,"I have very mixed feelings about this game. I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.  You move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.  The shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.  The place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.  Overall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20.",-1,0

3926524,307010,Northmark: Hour of the Wolf,"This is a collectible card game (CCG) with a few riddles thrown in for good measure.  Storywise, there's an attempted assassination and a conspiracy to uncover. You do this by traveling around the world map, exploring locations and fighting baddies.  The card game is fairly simple. You can have up to 3 units, limited by your command points (gained by leveling), and each unit can take one action per turn. An action is playing a card, whether an attack or a boost card. Units have built in cards that you get by clicking their picture, these will refresh after a while. You attempt to get high attack values, so your attack cards will penetrate your opponents' defense values, damage and eventually kill them by reducing their health to 0. There’s both physical attack and a number of different magic attacks, and it’s really impossible to guard effectively against all of them.  Since cards do not have casting costs, only costs to obtain, there is rarely any reason to use lower damage cards, unless they bring some sort of debuff or damage over time effect. You can only have 12 cards in your deck at a time, from about 100 that you can obtain, and since most of them will be lower tier, there is very limited deck construction. Balance is definitely an issue, what with no casting cost, and some of the units are really overpowered. Generally speaking, the 5000 cost cards are the ones worth the price.  The AI is not anything special, most opponents can be easily overwhelmed if you build a half decent attack heavy deck, with a few buffs and healing thrown in. The sole exception to this is the broken card which switches your hand with your opponent’s. When the AI uses this on your tuned deck, and you get a hand full of crap, there’s a good chance you’ll auto lose.  There are a number of bugs, ranging from a quest that may become uncompletable to text that doesn’t properly reflect the gender of your character, should you choose the female avatar. For most people I imagine the 4 chapters of the game can be completed in 3-4 hours, less if you’re an experienced CCG player. As you near the end of the game, the English writing gets progressively worse, giving the game an unpolished and unfinished feel. This is further compounded by the ending which doesn’t resolve much.  Graphics and music are decent enough, though there are some issues with the cropping of the character images. I would cautiously recommend this game for people in need of a quick CCG or simple RPG fix, but you have to take into account the simplicity of the card game and the short length of the overall game. It starts out fairly fun and refreshing, but once you understand how to best stock your deck and obtain the power cards, the excitement tapers off.",1,0

2409708,242940,Anachronox,"This is perhaps the single most amusing and entertaining old school RPG I have played. If you like tons of humor, including referential humor, and you also like going on a quest to save the galaxy with the most ragtag band of misfits imaginable, then this is the game for you.  The game's story is simultaneously engaging and outrageous. The gameplay is a little clunky but it controls just fine. Mostly my issue with it is it is counterintuitive; to interact with your environment, you have to move the mouse around until a little icon pops up, and you move the camera by mousing to the screen edge. I'd rather play with a gamepad, but it isn't supported. The graphics are really, really, REALLY old school but they get the point across. If graphics are an important thing to you, don't expect much from this game. The sound is surprisingly good for its time; I particularly like that most of the game is fully voiced. I don't find the game to have much replayability, however, although it can be worth it to find what you missed. Irritiating as it is, I recommend playing this game with a guide for all the side quests. Many of the side things you can do in Anachronox do not appear in your quest log, and it is vry easy to miss content. In my case, I probably will play Anachronoc again every two years or so. The story is that worthwhile.  Oh, and don't wprry about leveling up, the game auto levels you to the 'minimum level' when you reach certain areas, which makes a good tactician very unlikely to lose the game. Especially if you keep items on hand for healing and so forth. If you want grinding, exhausting challenge and the need to level up as much as possible, play it on hard.

The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at certain key moments within the battles, players can feel the Force as a Jedi. For the first time ever, Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space combat and, during the same battle, board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship, players can enter the spacecraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within! Or, they can simply stay inside their own capital ship and defend it from attacks and enemy fire. The choice is theirs. The stellar online play that marked the original Star Wars Battlefront returns even bigger and better for Star Wars Battlefront II. Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more players than ever' 9/10",1,0

3373987,275850,No Man's Sky,"The game has potential, but still needs alot of work to make it worthwhile.  Starting off, you are on a planet with no real backstory as to why you are there, or where you are going.  You learn how to collect resources and build the things you need to get your ship working, then you are off to explore.  The exploration is definately fun, and the scope of the galaxy and planets are massive beyond compare, but it lacks alot of basic features and content.   There is no planetary map to know where things are that you have already explored.  There are no character skills, it's all gear/ship oriented.  There are no civilizations, no cities, no communities on planets at all, just random little sheds with a single alien, or ancient ruins that speak of great alien races that are now just scattered little random encounters.  Space combat is there, but has no basic features of target selecting, or even ship identification.  You can craft some items and enhancment for your gear, but there is no ship building, and no ability to create your own buildings or anything.  The whole game seems focussed around getting more inventory slots so you can collect more resources, which you really have no use for other than keeping your ship and gear running so you can do some more site seeing.  The search for the ultimate space adventure continues. Sadly this isnt it.  If you are looking for better space emersion I recommend the following:  The X series by Egosoft Mass Effect Empyrion Galactic Survival  As much as I enjoy just flying around and exploring, it gets old fast without any goals or reason for being where you are, and the lack of anything really interesting to explore other than just randomly generated planets and creatures.   So I cannot recommend this for $60.00.",-1,1

The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title.",1,0

3041078,262260,Jets'n'Guns Gold,"I usually don't write reviews, but I rarely encounter games as good as Jets'n'Guns Gold. Inspired by Tyrian 2000, Project-X, Walker, R-Type, and Darius, this old school side-scrolling shooter offers wicked difficulty as well as wicked charm.  Instead of collecting weapons akin to R-Type, this game takes a page from Tyrian where you have the option of buying weapons after you complete each level. And trust me you are going to need to upgrade as soon as possible because each level gets progressively more and more difficult. Gamers looking for a breeze need not apply because it is not easy.  The graphics to J'n'G are reminiscent of an old 2D side-scrolling shooter. Nothing to hold in high acclaim, but still very nice to look at. Has kind of computer 90s feel. J'nG Gold also offers a comic book intro and outro to each level(or at least during the first few levels, I haven't gotten too far into it), which is also very nice.  Oh and the music? Fantastic! Machinae Supremacy and its sister production company, Hubnester Industries does a fantastic job at providing a heavy metal and chiptune atmosphere. Trust me, the music definitely adds a lot to already great game.  If you like great side-scrolling shooters, please buy this game. It's $3 right now, but even if it is $6.99 J'nG is still worth the price.",1,0

4114997,319270,Great Permutator,"Having now played over 80 hours of Great Permutator and reaching #1 on the leaderboards, I feel like I should update the review, or actually, write a proper one.   Great Permutator is an unassuming game when you first see it, but turns out to be an extraordinary one as soon as you scratch the surface. The premise is simple enough - you have to transport red, blue and yellow blocks from the upper side of the screen to the bottom, using unlimited number of conveyor belts and a limited supply of special blocks, while fitting them all on a 11x11 board. However, after only a few levels you will find yourself scratching your head and wondering how to sort them properly.  And after that, the game grips your brain in its claws and never lets go. There are lots of levels that will make you think they're impossible, and make you feel oh-so-smart when you finally solve them.. that is, until you realise that getting it solved is just a beginning of the road.  Where the game shows its real greatness is the fact that every level has several different solutions. If you played many puzzle games, you know well enough that often a level has only correct solution, as devised by the author, and either you reach it or be stuck. Not in Great Permutator. Here you can solve the level by occupying 100+ tiles and be done with it. Or you can try to get an A+ solution. But while A+ solutions are good enough to get the achievement, they are not sufficient to snatch a good spot on the leaderboards.  Every level, apart from having a predefined (and known in advance) number of tiles you can occupy to get A+, has a world record, established by unknown player(s) and stored on the server. And reaching it is exponentially harder than reaching A+, to the point that as of now *nobody* found the best solutions to *all* levels at the same time. And even when someone does, there can still be some levels that can be solved in another, better, but yet unexplored way.  That said, I have little doubt that the game's author is a genius and I can't wait for more levels, as hinted by the now-empty 'Add-ons' tab. Thank you for that GREAT game! ;-)  ----------------------- The old 'review': The name of the game says it all: it's about permutation and it's really great. ;-)",1,1
2427248,244090,Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies,"Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is the sequel to Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. This is not a carbon copy, however, and more was done than simply swapping models and textures.  So what's different? Primarily the setting, although quite a few game mechanics have been changed.  As the name suggests, the game takes place in the pacific theatre of war. The only nations involved are the Empire of Japan and the United States of America. Unfortunately, this reduces the overall choice the player has, since they basically get the option of choosing Army or Navy for either nation. At least each branch has their own planes, so you'll only see a F6F Hellcat when playing the US Navy or a P38 Lightning when playing the US Army.   I have to admit, it's somewhat disappointing the only two options are the USA and Japan. Granted, that's to be expected given the location the game takes place in, but I enjoyed having four different nations to play in Ace Patrol. I can understand the decision to take this route, as the war in Europe would've looked even more like a rehash of Ace Patrol. Even so, the multi-national feel of the first game held more appeal for me.  Like the first Ace Patrol, you have four pilots. They can earn promotions, gain abilities, get callsigns (which give them a unique trait, such as becoming immune to anti-aircraft fire), become injured or captured by the enemy. There's also two new options available: you can make all pilots male or have both male and female (like the first Ace Patrol), and you can allow pilots to die.  Unlike the first Ace Patrol, abilities are no longer tied to the pilot himself. Instead, these abilities are installed on the aircraft. That means each new aircraft you get has no upgrades, even if the plane itself is better in numerous categories. Fortunately, you can switch back and forth between all planes, so if you liked an older plane more than the newest one, you can fly that.  One reason the ability to switch between planes is important because, unlike the first Ace Patrol, aircraft damage isn't repaired after every mission. Instead, damage persists until the campaign is over (admittedly, campaigns are only four missions each, so they don't take much time to complete) and then your plane is fully repaired.   The only exception is the 'Grease Monkey' callsign, which lets that pilot repair their plane in small increments after each mission. Callsigns are presented after shooting down seven enemy planes; however, which four callsigns you have to choose from (for each pilot) is selected at random, so you might not see 'Grease Monkey' appear or all four pilots could be offered it.   Another change is that you no longer get to select which mission you fly. In the first Ace Patrol, you could choose between three missions (sometimes only one was available, but in those missions the entire squadron flew), but in Pacific Skies, the mission is given to you. As each campaign consists of four missions, you could easily end up flying the same type of mission four times in a row.   The game's graphics are no better (but no worse) than Ace Patrol, except for one area: the pilots themselves. This may be a personal preference, but I preferred the way the pilots look in Ace Patrol. In Pacific Skies, they look like deformed bobble-head dolls. Even more confusing is when pilots gain rank, their emblems or pins don't change, they just gain extra pieces of flight gear. Gain a rank and you'll get goggles, for instance. Sometimes medals don't even show up, despite the fact you were told that pilot was awarded one as well.  Would I recommend Pacific Skies? Only if you really liked Ace Patrol and you've got a strong interest in World War II, particularly the pacific theatre. I don't think Pacific Skies is as 'fun' as the original Ace Patrol, but I've always had a stronger interest in World War I than World War II, so perhaps that's my own personal bias getting in the way.",1,0

6240397,70300,VVVVVV,"Okay, let's get one thing out of the way right now. If you're a completionist, VVVVVV is difficult. It lies pleasantly between hand-holding inanity and the masochistic slog of insanity like Super Meat Boy, but it nevertheless will require many, many deaths in order to get all the collectables.  With that being said, this game *oozes* charm, mostly by pretending to be a Commodore 64 game. You get it all here: The loading screen, the simplistic pixel graphics and gameplay, the baffling choice of obstacles... the only thing missing are rockin' SID chiptunes. The soundtrack is more Mega Man than Dizzy.  Besides that, I've always been a sucker for gravity flip mechanics. You'll have to spend a significant amount of time on some screens in order to pass them, but the checkpoint system is forgiving, and respawn time is near negligible. If you have a little patience, and you're willing to fail, you'll go a long way without getting frustrated. (Be warned, though: Some of the collectables are rough.)  Bottom line: As long as you have a little experience with 8-bit platformers, VVVVVV isn't nearly as bad as modern day hyperdifficult platforms. It's actually *enjoyable*. By the time you're done, you'll come to love these goofy blockheaded astronauts, let alone the game itself.",1,0

5679772,45760,Ultra Street Fighter IV,"SSFIVAE is a 2.5D fighting game that has a lot of different characters, all with unique playstyles and moves.  Gameplay: The gameplay is great; there's alot of special attacks and unique attacks specific to each character, combos are difficult but satisfying, and playing on the keyboard is pretty tough so I would suggest getting a controller to play.  Content: SSFIVAE has an Arcade mode which has a cutscene at the beginning, a series of matches against AI or a second player, 2 minigames built in, then a cutscene about specific rival, you face the rival, then you face Seth: the game's 'boss'. There are 24 specific trials to each character which make you do special moves and combos that allow you to train and get better with a character.  Multiplayer: For the most part, the multiplayer is smooth, fast, and rarely has lag. Occasionaly you will get put up against someone that has network problems but you can always back out before you go into a match. There are 4 gamemodes in the multiplayer: ranked match, endless match, team battle, and tournament. In a ranked match, you will gain and lose player points(points specific to your profile) and battle points(points specific to a character). The PP and BP will be visible to the other people in a lobby/match with you. The multiplayer also goes through GFWL(Games for Windows Live), which most people don't like, but I've heard that its shutting down soon, so don't worry.  Visuals and Audio: The graphics are great, it has a cartoony style to it and the characters have a cool black outline on them. The maps are really cool, and they all have animations to them(besides the training stage). The sounds are really good aswell,  there's great voice acting, but occasionally the map music gets a little repetitive.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone. 9/10 ",1,0

If they are under 21 they'll complain about lack of story, too fast etc.  If they are 21-29 ish they'll complain about how it isn't horror and Doom 3 was nothing like this etc.  If however your 30+ and remember playing Doom in early / mid 90s you'll love this, (unless your total classic doom purist)  I'm 30+ and I remember playing Doom back in 1994, you couldn't stop playing it always 'one more level'. Well I was playing 'one more level' last night and the night before.  This isn't Classic Doom, but it feels like what Classic Doom would be if made in 2016, all the good bits with the addition of things like the glory kills that spawn ammo and health, not to make it easy but keep the brutal pace of the murder at breakneck speeds. It's keeps things going.  It takes some things from Quake too like Quad Damage and double jumps (Quake 2 IIRC).  It takes away all the things I hate about Modern Single player FPS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story, waiting around for doors to be opened, everything is serious no humour, only 2 weapons, health regen etc etc etc.  Wolfenstein: TNO was a breath of fresh air and showed you do old school Single player FPS with a story (And given the setting of Wolfenstein vs Doom it makes this that would have more story)  Doom is like a hurricane of fresh air, it destroys everything in it's path it's truly amazing, it has story sure, but it's not important it's optional... killing is the main meat of the game, just like it was in 1994.  I hope we start to see some more single player FPS like Wolfenstein: TNO and Doom...... A Lovecraftian Quake 1 Single Player campaign WITH a decent multiplayer would be awesome.  It also runs like a dream, on my i5-3570k @ 4.7 ghz, 16gb Ram, 980ti it averages 120fps with dips rarely below 100 on Ultra + Nightmare Settings.  To top it all off Mick Gordon's soundtrack on this game is amazing, his work on Wolfenstein: TNO and Killer Instinct was great but this legendary, one of the best original soundtracks in a game I've ever played.   So do I recommend this... If you played Doom in mid 1990s yes 100%.   If you want a Doom 3 like experience... NO  If you want a new CoD.... try it you might like it.  Also play it on Ultra-Violence minimum, it isn't a complete walk in the park then, it's a challenge.",1,0

3269881,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.   I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on 'high', except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.  You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.  If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.  Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.  GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.  I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.  I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit 'Z' to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.  GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.  Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",1,0

971937,212800,Super Crate Box,"This game is super cool. First when I saw its screenshots, I thought that it will suck like other games of its kind. But since my favourite genre of games is Indie, I tried it out. The first thing that amazed me was its size. It is normal for a GameMaker game to be around 100 Mb, but this came out at 18 Mb. Secondly, I don't like difficult games that much. The only difficult game which I ever played was PacMan, when i was 7 years old on my GameBoy Advance. This was next. Great difficulty, not too much, not too less. I don't know how I still like this game although my highscore is 8! Now to the bad side. There are many weapons, but some weapons like the minigun are very difficult to use. Some weapons like the katana (if my spelling is correct) should be given in the starting of the game because they are practically useless. Since this game is like a platformer, I had expected that if we jump on top of an enemy, the enemy dies. The pause menu in-game doesn't work. It shows some error saying that a file wasn't found.

I was hoping to gain enough confidence to preform real work. I wanted to be able to select car jacks and measure nut and bolt sizes. I wanted to be able to tighten bolts to specifications. I wanted to be able to shop for different brands of brake pads and purchase brake pads for specific cars. 50 dollars for one brake pad is so unrealistic.   The game looks nice and was quick to setup.

It was cool to play Co-op, but you cannot communicate at all, neither kick. Often people joined and couldn't play at all, they kept dying which meant we had to start over again from the last checkpoint. And some of them just didn't want to learn how to avoid attacks from a boss so I ended up playing it entirely singleplayer sometimes.  It doesn't feel that natural to drive around in their vehicle form, but on the other side it was a little bit fun. You have a lot of action in this game and an interesting story.

Coins can, of course, be used to buy items or increase the number of objects you can stock.  A few hours into the game these items will dramatically increase in price.   Now, the real goal is to find and create combos. Combining certain items will unlock an achievement and earn you lots of money. And what for ? To buy new items, you got it ! These combos are a must if you want to complete the game, by the way.   Most gamers should be able to finish it in 3,5 hours or so. So it's not all that long, and the time limit for deliveries artificially lengthens the game as well, which is a real shame.  The graphics and animations are cute and beautiful. And the fire looks quite amazing, with all the ashes and whatnot. Impressive stuff if you ask me.   The music is minimal, but memorable. Especially the Weather Balloon song got my attention. All in all it's a fun game but I wish it was even deeper than this. It's still a bit too shallow for my taste.  [Rating: 78/100]",1,0

I first started with single player and after I had played it in two evenings was complete (I couldn't stop, might have another go) was around 6 to 8 hours long though it was a blast sometimes it was, damn bomber squigs. Then I moved to the multiplayer and I found it a good chill out game the co-op last stand and vs both bring a nice difference in game modes.  I give 8/10 all round.  P.S I was thinking of getting Warhammer 40k: Eternal Crusade which I’m sooo glad I didn't. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is 100% better even now, it's worth your money and worth it more than Eternal Crusade. but don't think that's why you should get it as it is worth getting even if you had Eternal Crusade.",1,0

5120348,391540,Undertale,"I softly recommend this game in a soothing and non-irritating manner for anyone who likes games.   But please keep in mind that this is a game that wants to have a game/player relationship with you personally. It can be difficult to have that, to see a game's true flaws and virtues, and ultimately get invested when so many other people are praising it. Everyone praising it is being truthful, that they had a good experience with the game. But please ignore them, and don't let their opinions create expectations for you. Experience it yourself.  If it helps you get comfortable, wait until the hype settles down (unless you are reading this after it already has). But avoid spoilers.   If being more story-driven than gameplay-driven is a turn-off for you, I understand. I usually feel the same way. But don't write Undertale off right away. Because if that's the type of person you are, and you're aware of it and would use those words, you are probably also interested in seeing what can be done in video games' narratives that can't be done in other forms of media.

EDIT = I had to go through and be polite by changing around some of those cruel words.  TLDR:  Player Base = Cringy as all hell, think it's made for furries, also dying hellah fast, maybe that original price of $30 didn't really make enough sense and killed some boners.  Game Play = Bad, there are clearly OP heros and clearly Trash heros.  OP Heros ======= Ninja Tony Poison Lady Cogwheel  In-the-middle ========== Sarge Hamster thing  Trash Heros ======== Nigel Yeti Planet Girl Genie Vander Graff - only know his name cause i bought him and played him a bit  Been playing since it was released on steam for actual play, but costed something. I got it for free due to them giving out keys back then but actually purchased the skins. It was eh at best back then and is porbbaly worse now.  Your name is different within the name, giving ability for the use of clan tags. Problem is, is they'll actual conduct background investigations on who created what clan tag where.  My friends and I had discovered a multitude of the most egotistical little ♥♥♥♥ clans such as |GS| and |KS|. These two tend to stand out the most, harboring the most egotism.  We planned to go to the 'amazing' block and load website and change our names to |GS| and act like complete dics to make our teammates along with the other team's members think our clan is entirely trash and that we're complete controlling asshats.  This was all fun and games until the day we ended up in a game with the actual leader of the clan who saw and questioned the fact there were 3 unknown members who were talking ♥♥♥♥ to the entire lobby. I think during that game I was acting as if I was an officer and I'd bark orders at the lessers of the clan, being my two friends.  He got uspet and sent an email, naming my friends and I as false members.....  These contact support workers or whatever you wish to call them...did a ♥♥♥♥ing background check on who and what, whether it be who was in the clan, or who had the name first, they had an investigation on who's been in the clan longer essentially.  We couldnt stop laughing because we had all recieved emails but it was amazing,  But it's alright the plan was for us to become 'MLG' at a kids game by actually having a ranking in the high end of the game, somewhere in the 500s.     If you want an actual reivew  Pros ===== + Decently New Concept + Take ideas from the player base  + Fun creative characters + Can fill a full team full of the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ god damn character making people ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Other than that  Cons ===== - Ninja is autistically strong, you'll see multiple fukers playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥r - Poison Lady is really strong too, pretty much cancer. - Tony, some guy who plays with his caulk, thing is his turrents are actual ♥♥♥♥ing stupid strong - Community is cringe aids - Game is made for kids - The playerbase can't speak english and when they do it's like speaking to a customer support located in India - Pretty sure the playerbase is also a bunch of little kids or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ furries who cry at the slightest thing.   - / + Negative and a Positive, Nigel is actual ♥♥♥♥, but like he's fun to mess around with because people don't like it when you pick him.   Overall Judgement =============  I hate the game, honestly I think I've lost my eyesight at how poorly design this game is, there is NO BALANCE. I spent money on this ♥♥♥♥ only because I thought my friend and I were actually going to play it...was better than the other options of Unturned and Verdun at the time.",-1,0

The game looks good, runs ok. Not as well as other more CPU/GPU intensive games that I own but I noticed it was a little laggy fps wise.  The big drawback for me is that there is an extremely low amount of players that actually play this game. I finally get it installed, start the game up and there are a grand total of 19 people playing this game. That's 19 people combined between 2 servers out of atleast 20 dedicated servers! The other issue besides extremely low game pop is the fact that you can't seem to join servers when the game started. I tried joined the 2 servers that had people playing. Even though there were space in both, it just sat on the joining game screen forever, only to find out that I'm not getting into the server and cancel joining the game.  I'll play this again when the overal game pop grows and it's a little more optimized so there is better FPS.  Overall it has great potential but with the issues I spoke about, I give this a 6/10.

3353927,275200,Westerado: Double Barreled,"I haven't had this much fun playing a western game since Red Dead Redemption. Westerado: Double Barreled is a game about getting revenge on the bandit that burned down your home and murdered your family. The game thrust you into the west with nothing more than a hat and revolver and tell you find killer.  You must go through out the west completing quests for various people to get enough information to successfully identify the killer. The killer is random NPC, so his appearance change every playthrough. You can kill anyone in the game, so if you choose to just go on a rampage till you get the right one that could be an option. The missions can range from protecting a herd of buffalo, working with natives to take on the rangers, or clearing out a cave full of bandits. The combat allow you to shoot in either the left or right direction and you can move up and down to avoid gun fire. Hats are the system health system. The more hats you have the more hits can take, but once you run out the next hit will be fatal.   This game sound and feel like a western. It got so many winks and nods to westerns, there no way I could get through them all. Heck the main town is name Clintville, and they even manage to throw in a Doctor Who reference. But I digress. The game set the mood as western film, and with the game being an open sandbox you can really explore the west. Also the soundtrack is just amazing, never had I wish to download a OST as much as with this game.   Once the game have been completed under certain conditions you can unlock up to 3 additional characters, all with their own unique play style. Combine this with the fact that you can buy guns in games, along with clothes, and a house and well let just say you can get a lot of mileage out this game.  Honestly I like the western setting in game and feel it an underrated genre. Westerado fulfill my need for a western game and let me choose whether I can be the lone hero of the west or a mass murderer killing everyone till I get my revenge.",1,0

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

32417,102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"Oh boy, this game.  Well, it's fun, the combat is very fast paced and fun, you can do a lot of moves with you skills and magic and abilities, you can combine them or charge them for a more powerful attack.   This game is HUGE, the map is VERY HUGE, there is a lot of dungeons and there is like 300 or 400 side quests to be done, but it is very unlikely that you will want to do every single one, you see, some of them, some of the quests are like the generic MMO quests (grab question with NPC &gt; kill x things &gt; collect x things &gt; go back to NPC), but there is a lot of side quests very well done and with a nice story.   Play this game on HARD, because even on HARD it will be kinda easy, seriously, you will only face a challenge if you decide to fight more than 6 enemies (of your LVL - the ones with the name in YELLOW) at once or an enemy with an ORANGE or RED name.  There is a lot of things to say about this game, but let me give you some tips that won't ruin your fun.  If you want to kill enemies with one or two hits, pick BLACKSMITH and JEWELCRAFTING skill to level up, you will be able to craft your own gear, but you can make some GODLY gear, like, you can gain +60% DMG with FIRE DMG and LIFE LEECH and a insane amount of ARMOR, you will never die, really, it will look like GOD MODE. If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).  Try to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.  Choose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).  Try to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.  Try to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).  Try to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.  ***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***   There is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.  Thanks for reading.",1,0

An evolution of Telltale's ground-breaking choice and consequence game mechanics will ensure the player learns that even as Bigby Wolf, Sheriff of Fabletown, life in the big bad city is bloody, terrifying and dangerous.

1046819,215530,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing,"I was surprised by this title. It is reasonably well put together and enjoyable with great quips from the characters as you meander through the world. The quests are reasonable, although standard and they have a few scattered in the world as well. It is a bit more static than other games of this nature (At least up to the point I played) and I don't find the classes particularly gripping. The melee combat oriented Hunter, particularly, seems wildly unbalanced compared to the fellow wandering around with a flamethrower and his eyes closed and the purple outfit of the mage class just makes it something I want to put away. It is worth a play, but only really if you're a Van Helsing fan or a regular ARPG type fanatic. ",1,0

3408425,280160,Aragami,"Aragami is a positive addition to the stealth genre. It features intelligent level design that requires careful attention to level geometry, light sources, and shadows. The selection of enemies is quite limited, but the way they are distributed throughout each area makes for a fascinating experience despite the fact there are only two enemies in the game outside of the boss battles, which are all very stealth oriented and sometimes frustrating.  I would really like to commend the development team for the excellent 3d in-game cutscenes, music, and overall look and feel of this game. It feels like a movie at times, and has an interesting story that is revealed in bits and pieces as things progress. It reminds me a bit of Okami or Shadow of the Colossus in its presentation.  The various stealth powers and special moves are creative and useful. Co-op play was wonderful, my wife and I played the entire game together without any problems and had a great time doing it. Having the option to have one player distract guards by intentionally making noise, using special powers, or being almost spotted while the other player sneaks up on enemies to perform stealth kills is great.  Overall length of the game is about 10-15 hours depending on how fast you go. For 20 dollars this is a perfect stealth title to pick up which fans of Tenchu, Splinter Cell, or Metal Gear would most likely enjoy.",1,1

3370711,275850,No Man's Sky,"Review as of 8/12 with 4 hours of playtime  First and foremost, I'm going to address the issues. Right this moment the game is getting a ton of flak because of some hardware and compatibility issues. If you run into these issues, go to the forums and see if there are workarounds up. If not, please be patient.   Now the good. The game is amazing. There is so much going on that it is definately easy to get overhelmed with the size of it but if you are not in a hurry you can find interesting things in unexpected places. I'm dedicating myself to learning as much of the language of one of the spieces in the area I started in before I move on. It is really easy to spend hours (or I'm willing to bet days) just exploring a single planet.  The mixed. There is bit of a learning curve as the game has no tutorial. If you are expecting to be able to jump in and instantly understand everything you will be dissapointed.

2689992,251170,Damned,"Bought this game during a recent sale and tried to make it work for 3 other friends. I really wanted to like this game. The concept of 4 survivors vs. 1 monster on a server game was very appealing to me, and for $5 a person (during the sale) how could I really say no? The atmosphere is creepy, the sound is great, and once you understand the controls it plays well. Sure the elements get reused so you can't tell a level apart from another level and THE FOREST just crashes the game, but it's not that bad design-wise.  The direction in this game is lacking, playing as a survivor is confusing and difficult. Winning as a survivor requires finding a silver key and a crowbar/hammer and having all living survivors in the escape room for 10 seconds. Finding a key can unlock a door that does nothing or unlocks multiple doors and in almost 3 hours of playing we found 1 hammer out of 5 maps as survivors. It's frustrating walking around for 4 or 5 minutes and not being able to go anywhere if you don't find the right key in the right order.  Playing as a monster has its drawbacks depending on the monster, but it's still the most fun part of the game. The 'phantom' appears to play the easiest when it comes to finding survivors that aren't careful, the 'lurker' is the most terrifying but require the most guesswork when turning on/off corporeal form and 'mary' is irritating when she isn't charged and moves as slow as she does, but teleporting can land you in the best position or set you back at the worst time.  Also creating a profile and setting up a room/finding one can be annoying, but it's not Uplay... so there's that.  TLDR: Great look and feel, confusing and unbalanced gameplay  2/5 - Not Worth $5",-1,0

Also the grind takes away a big chunk of gameplay (Repeating Rats/Train over and over again hundreds of times is not what I call proper gameplay) and the prestige-like system only caters more to that, while not giving more variety",1,1

Thankfully, when you initially sit down at the table where your fate is decided, all questions go out the window as soon as the deckmaster speaks.

3876692,304050,Trove,"Updated as of June 25th, 2016  I am making this review as a NOT recommended.  To start off, the game is completely free ; Everything can be gotten in-game, with in-game currency, and a little bit of patience and good luck from RNG-esus / Lootcifer.  Except for classes. Now you have to buy those. Which is probably the biggest sin a company can make, when it's entire game revolves around levelling a class to max, and then moving to the next one. It used to be you got cubits, for free for doing dailies, that you could save up and use to unlock a class. Well, nope, not anymore because ♥♥♥♥-all.  Then we actually gotta talk about gameplay. Basically, the entire game is RNG. It's RNG whether you get good gear or bad gear drops. It's RNG whether the bosses will have abilities that will let them spawn a million enemies, or whether they just spawn ice around them. As you can tell, one situation is clearly worse than the other, and the dungeon you thought you could complete, turned out to steam roll your face. Item drop RNG can make or break you, and farming for the 'best gear' for a class can take a minute or a week.  But then let's talk about playing the game, besides doing dungeons. Do you like rubberbanding across the screen? How about instantly falling down to ground level while you fly high above? How about not using your potions when you need to, and instead use them after you revive at spawn? All those sound good? Nah? How about doing that one kill quest in an MMO over and over, because there's nothing else really to the game besides that one kill quest?  You see, this game would easily be a recommended game, if the servers weren't ♥♥♥♥ and the classes were back to free players. I could literally ignore the monotonous as ♥♥♥♥, paper-thin 'gameplay' if this was the case. The in-game store has more than enough ♥♥♥♥ for people to buy, they didn't need to paywall more ♥♥♥♥, but you know, it's ♥♥♥♥ing Trion. The RNG loot and boss abilities, I could sincerely look past as well, because it does offer a form of variety. But this ♥♥♥♥ is out of whack, and I cannot recommend it anymore as it has become a game full of pay-walls.  I played in Closed beta up until this point. I still play the game, because I have it, I have all the classes, I have good gear to get me through, despite the ♥♥♥♥ing rubberbanding and server lag, which they still have not fixed yet. But as someone who searches for F2P games, I cannot recommend this facade of deceit. It's deceitful to tell someone a game is free, when a good majority of the content (AKA classes) is locked behind a pay-wall, especially when the other majority of content made is by players, which would be item models and ocassionally costumes. I don't mind player made items in games, WARFRAME does it pretty well. But when half of the content is locked behind a paywall, and the other half isn't even made by the dev's themselves, you gotta scratch your head and wonder what is up with the development team.  For those looking for a good F2P game, go get Warframe or TF2, or ♥♥♥♥ even Agar.io or Slither.io for web-browsers. This game is not F2P.",-1,0

535586,203160,Tomb Raider,"First of all, this is a well made game(as of writing), from start to end of single player story, I've only encountered one crash to desktop, and one glitch in a tomb that I have to restart game to fix it. Which is rare consider how modern game development process is.(or maybe I play this game long after it's release and all the know bug are fixed.)  The story itself is convincing, doesn't get into the way too much, doesn't make you feel you are just playing yet another platformer plus third person shooter. Generally comparable to the formula that established by Uncharted, while trying something new(character progression/fast travel) with in it. Although it's not true open world, but at least you don't have to replay a chapter to recollect whatever you missed during your first run.(I completed 100% in one go.)  Gameplay and control is nice, combat is pretty straight forward if you have any third person shooter experience. Bow is extremely strong that you could probably finish this game with bow only as primary weapon. Progression is somewhat limited, doesn't give you much choice and you will eventually get everything if you collect everything. And I assume you need a progression system because at some stage of game development, they want to let player come back and explore previously limited area due to lack of proper equipment. But I don't think this is a good design, compare to say Metroid or Zelda, it is like experimenting and then decide to just dumb it down and play safe with more linear level design.  Puzzle is a bit weak, through out the game there are probably only 1~2 places that I have to think more than 10 mins, doesn't even have to use survival instinct(which is really good for item collection) No memerable boss fight, but I guess decent story can make up for this.   There are obvious quality difference between levels, some of the early or iconic levels have really well layout, really detailed item placement and textures, but there are also part of the game you can see tiled texture like coming from a early 2000 game. SE may want to put in more, but I guess the budget and deadline pushed those part of game level feel really out of place.  Generally, I hope they can have a bit more variation on platformer part of visual guide. Ideally, not so much like this one. It's almost to a point where I don't really have to think and know exactly where I need to go and do to get throguh this part of level. You don't have to do tutorial from start to the end and mark 'white means you can climb/grab', I hope there are more ways to approach a level and gadgets that promote even crazier movement options in the next installment.  I have no desire to play the multiplayer part, so I won't comment on those.   For a Tomb Raider reboot, the execution is pretty good. Too bad that 3 millions sold in first week is not good enough for that budget. I hope the next one given the engine is built, could be more profitable for SE. But still need to wait and see how they treat this franchaise.  ",1,0
5593105,443810,This Is the Police,"I enjoyed This is The Police, but after yet again being killed (day 23 this time), I have no will to keep going, and I can't recommend this game.  Every single playthrough is the SAME. The SAME calls will be made on the SAME days on the SAME time. The only 'randomness' is the cops you hire and can sometimes die where they didn't last time. The starting cops are ALWAYS the same as well.  The fact that the game doesn't give you an option to go back to ANY day you want (as opposed to the seemingly arbirtrary 'autosave' it gives you to load back) breaks the game for me. I have no incentive to replay the game yet again just to go through exactly the same scenarios all over again.  The worst part is that I know what decision made me fail, and if I could just reload the game to a single earlier day, I would be able to keep going. But no, the only choices I have is go back to day 12 or 5, or start a whole new game all over again.  No thanks. I'm sadly done with this game.",-1,0

It has a great concept in terms of gameplay and it was well over a year ago I noticed Overkill dishing out large amounts of DLC, but let it slide anyways.

Its been a while since i played the game, and dont think ill be playing it anytime soon. Game is great back then? Absolutely. Now? Look at the total amount of DLCs, and the worst part? More microtransactions within and you thought you could finally stop spending after getting majority of the DLCs. Unless you're rich af, stay away from this game because Overkill pretty much cares about the money more than the so called 'community' they once promised about.  POST EDIT (8th Oct 2016) Now that microtransactions are out of the way, the game and its community seem to want back to a much stable form. Take note that I would highly recommend to buy it during sales as it still has tons of DLC's as a con, but the new heists and content that were recently added kept the game much more enjoyable than before.",-1,0

When I heard it was coming out for PC, I was ecstatic and was completely okay with spending another $60 on Rockstar's masterpiece.  However...  When it came out, the graphics were terrible for me, I fixed them to 1190x1080, and it made me go to the windowed version only if I wanted good graphics. Not only are the graphics good however, multiple scenery, people, and vehicles around my GTA5 world are looking like Minecraft. Mostly everything is pixelated outlines of grey. I've grown used to the windowed version, and the pixelated outlines. But, what really gets on my nerves are the crashes. It'll crash at the most random times. I'd be walking out a building, and boom, crash. I'd be in an online race, and drifting around a corner. Boom, crash. It's getting real annoying.   My processor is an AMD Athlon, 3.00GHz. I was hoping Rockstar could fix these issues soon.  Otherwise, the game is great. First person is great, the new content is great, next-gen is great, hardly any lag.   Everything in GTA5 PC is great except for those 3 bugs.  I'd rate it 7/10, very buggy for me, but understandable due to it's very recent release.",1,1

Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?  No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo?

2957253,257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"I enjoy every minute that I play this game--I love the soundtrack, the gameplay, and especially the art style. While the game only took me about 5 hours to complete, there is a New Game+ mode that essentially means most enemies will kill you in one shot. I wanted this game to be a little more challenging than it was, so playing the New Game+ is very enjoyable to me. $20 is a little expensive, but I think that overall it is worth it, even if you don't get the old $1/hour rule that I *usually* go by.   *Edit: New Game+ took an additional 5-6 hours to complete, and I only enjoyed the game more. However, after a greuling 2 hours spent on the first boss, i died only once in the rest of New Game+. I don't know if this is a common problem, but I largely felt that the game was too easy--I loved that feeling of finally beating the first boss, but the rest of the game felt like a cakewalk. However, I continue to discover more of the game's lore/story, and continue to enjoy the art and soundtrack. Despite the game feeling a little easy, I can't recommend enough that you give it a shot, it is well worth your $15.  Also, if you're not like me, maybe you'll enjoy all the completionist stuff the game has to offer (i think somewhere like 186 gearbits, 32 diamonds/shards, several unlockable outfits, 20ish 'keys' and things behind locked doors, etc etc. There's even a soccer mode.  Also Also, if you are like me, the next thing you do afrter beating New Game + is to achievement hunt. However, as of 4/23/16 the achievements are quite glitchy and won't always be awarded, as with many steam achievements. Obviously this is a small problem and shouldn't influence whether you buy the game.",1,0

Alternating between stupid and staggeringly ambitious, AitD remains possibly the most singular survival horror game 'genre piece' made to date. Systems upon fiddly systems of needless simulation that nonetheless serve to give the player a wonderful sense of agency in the world. My recommendation however; *use* the ability to fast forward. There are sections of the game that are almost unplayable, such as the early car escape. Skip it! The game lets you! To get to the 'actual game', fast forward to the chapter immediately following the car escape. AitD is by far at its best when it's a free-form open world roaming 'sim', so play it that way. Experiment, poke at it, laugh at it. It's a rube goldberg device masquerading as a horror game. At this price, I cannot recommend it enough.",1,0

819693,209370,Analogue: A Hate Story,"After getting 95% of the way through this game in one sitting, with 4/5 endings unlocked (god damn harems!), I have to fully recommend this game.  I've never played a VN quite like this. Whilst trying to retrieve data on a space mission, you meet two AI girls with very different viewpoints on the situation you slowly uncover. The interface is slick, but with the addition of the console window (that plays a very important role!) is something completely out of the blue. The intertwining accounts from various points of view all build an amazing, interesting, and sometimes very hot story.  If you just like to have the story play out for you, with only a few choices, then this isn't the game for you. If you're looking for something with the right amount of story and interactive gameplay (without stat building!) then I highly recommend Analogue.",1,0

Multiplayer issues if a person is stood infront of you what ever you mine or chop/kill goes to them instead of you.   The game is fun don't get me wrong but these issues are down right annoying later in the game where mobs have the potential to one shot you and you have it pass through your sword swing and die then its back to the start.  out of 10 I would say this game is a 7 because its addictive the flaws I have mentioned are the only things holding this game back from being great.",1,0

While it's kinda fun at first, you soon realize that there are no puzzles except a single one that requires you to think a tiny bit. Everything else is just a game of finding things hidden behind some objects, which is indeed kind of enjoyable tho.  Personally, while it's not that expensive, I think the price is still too high for the 10-15 minutes of gameplay it provides. Because of that and the missing replay value, I'm going to give it a negative review. I wish there were a 'neutral' review option.  EDIT: After some good points brought up by the dev (read comments on this review) I changed my rating to positive.

443542,200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Yes, this game was made by the same guys who made Civilization. Yes, you will say 'just one more turn/battle/other increment of play' until you realize you've been playing longer than you meant to. But that's a good thing.  XCOM is divided into two sorts of games. There's the management portion, where you manage your XCOM base, research new technologies, launch satelites, destroy UFOs, manage you (initially very small) budget and try not to let the worldwide panic go up too high. This portion of the game starts out fairly challenging, with multiple countries in states of panic depening on your choices and a limited budget that you must decide what to do with. However, this challenge soon becomes non-existent. Late in the game you end up no longer facing the choice of which of two countries to help, and panic seldom goes over a single bar. Though to be fair, this really only happens when you're completing all of your missions without fail.  The other portion of the game is the tactical combat portion. In this part you send your squad of up to 6 soldiers into specific missions. This part remains engaging throughout. It plays like a turn-based, cover-based shooter. Which is an interesting mix. Later in the game you get more abilities for your soldiers, which creates some interesting choices. Facing a new type of enemy can be interesting as you don't know what kinds of things they are capable of (will they do heavy damage? Mind control your soldiers? Do damage to you if they die near you?) though that effect wears off when you've seen all there is to offer. Death for your soldiers is permanant, but in some cases you can save them by getting them a medikit when they fall.  The two portions of the game are engaging on their own, and feed into one another nicely.  I do have a few gripes with the game though. I wish when soldiers went down they would ALWAYS be able to be revived with a medikit, as it seems to be based on chance now, and can be frustrating. Late game can be a bit unchallenging as well, but that's really only an issue if you're just grinding to max out your levels before the final battle. (Which is easier than I thought it would be, so grinding isn't recommended anyway.) Even when doing that though, a wrong move can still mean death for your soldiers. The ending is also kind of... meh. Lots of questions left, few answers. It does leave things open for a sequel though.   I highly recommend this game if you're into thinking-type games. If you're looking for another mindless shooter where you blow up aliens... look elsewhere. Great replay value as well, with multiple difficulty settings.",1,1

I've always wanted to be able to travel through the universe and see things that no one will ever even dream of and this was, what I had hoped to be, my closest opportunity to that dream becoming reality.  Evidently the devs made this game with the Steam two hour refund window in mind. Within two hours, I had seen pretty much everything this game had to offer. All the planets, life, and resources were very generic and had an easily recognizable pattern.   I was past the Steam refund time so I decided to keep playing and hope I would find something interesting enough to make me continue to actually want to play it. It even became a grind to have enough resources to be able to travel to other galaxies, not to mention that, even with largely upgraded slots on my suit and my ship, I was constantly running out of room and almost impossible to find somewhere to sell the junk.  TLDR: grindy, not fun for more than a few hours at best, way overhyped, and as many other reviews have stated - promises went unfulfilled.

The actual concept of the game is really unique as it treats normal encounters/monsters as actual beings with dialoge and personality, making encounters so much fun. The actual character development is beautiful as each character has its own story and background, giving everyone layers of interpretation. You just bond with these characters so well.  Not only that but hidden dialoge, secrets and areas make the game have so much more depth. THIS GAME IS BASICALLY ALIVE!!! It takes 'resetting' into the actual plotline and the actual structure of everything is so well thought out. It may not look exciting with its 8 bit graphics, but damn, it just feels so alive: characters, plot, player interaction- EVERYTHING!!!  Pros: -Secrets EVERYWHERE -Different path ways -Character development -THERES A PLOTLINE AND AN EVEN BIGGER PLOTLINE INVOLVING TIMELINES -Battles mean so much more -Impactful (die by your decisions) -You can win the game at level 1 -Hella rad music -Jam packed with personality -Every single character in this game is gold -It has DOGS -AND FONTS -Really questions you as a gamer and how every charcter is effected by what you do in the game and what you do to the actual game itself. -mindfuks everywhere.  Cons: -Graphics could be better but honestly, gameplay over graphics if you ask me. -You dont want to play this again, unless your a genocidal monster and you want to reset everyones happiness, then go ahead.

1767769,228400,ACE COMBAT™ ASSAULT HORIZON Enhanced Edition,"Good, but the game could have been better. Heli and AC-130 missions are a huge pain because objectives are usually timed, enemies have no reticules, and guns have limited zoom (AC-130). Also the AI engages dogfighting near constantly. This leads to a lot of instances where you're trying to chase a mission critical target while the AI is constantly engaging in dogfight mode and lobbing endless missiles.  I also don't know how 'realistic' I'd call the story. Outside of the fact the main characters are as bland as Elmer's glue, the magic mcguffin weapon is a nuke in all but name. The story reminds me heavily of CoD:MW's story. If you've played any of the MW games then you'll be able to predict where the story is going. Hell, I called the first plot twist during the first cutscene. In fact the whole game reminds me of a CoD game. Heavily scripted in an attempt to shove you into the best pov to see the explosions. It even has bloody screen so real, and regenerating health.  AC:AH removes the previous AC system of buying planes and instead gives you a whole choice of planes........that the game decides is appropriate for the mission. The problems with that is it removes the feeling of accomplishment from buying your favorite plane, and the game rarely tells you what mission you're preparing for, and what enemies you'll be facing. So be prepared for missions you go into blind, and end up taking the wrong missiles/bombs.  Lastly the missions can be very frustrating, and take vast amounts of luck instead of skill. The mission over Moscow is a prime example of this. In the last section you have to shoot down a plane carrying the magic mcguffin. Problem with this is the game throws in 4 escorts and a boss that all home in on you the moment you enter the same continent. So you have to chase a bomber on a very small timer while 5 guys try to shove perfect accuracy missiles up your nose. I failed that mission so many times because despite any maneuvers I pulled I would have 6 missiles slam into me. I finally beat it because the AI bugged out. The fighters didn't chase me, and the bomber didn't launch it's never ending chaff supply, so missles actually managed to hit it. This is just 1 example out of a dozen. The next best one was the ICBM that could evade advanced A2A missiles, and had to be shot down in mere seconds.  If you just want to flight around and blow things up then this is your game. If your expecting Ace Combat then you'll be disappointed. It's fun, but it isn't an Ace Combat game. It's a shame we'll probably never see a true Ace Combat game on PC. I'd love a reason to break out my old flight stick. maybe add some modding tools for skins, and maps.",1,0

956759,212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"Personally I decided to review this before playing it much so I could share some initial impressions. I really enjoy this and it's really great to be able to sit down for like 45 minutes and get in a run of the game as it's not something you have to sit though and play all at once or you lose your memory of it. It is really addicting though and you'll likely want to just play one more game after finishing, so watch out for that!  Gameplay/mechanic wise it is a little complicated at first but once you pick up on it then it's pretty easy to understand and it sticks with you. Basically the point of the game is that you're the commander of a ship and you're travelling around and when doing so you come across encounters that can either be things like an enemy ship you have to fight, or a friendly person just lookin for some help, and things in between. Depending on how you want to play, the game offers that choice. Each time you want to play, you can pick different ships and difficulties depending on how you're feeling at the time.   So far it's really fun and I'm enjoying it, and I think this game offers a lot of replayability and thus value for money, since there are so many different things that can happen when playing.",1,0

5877792,50130,Mafia II (Classic),"Although I've never played the first game, this is an interesting title, which somehow follows the same mechanics that were introduced by the modern games of the GTA franchise. There's this difference on it that I found weird though (although it's simply the concept of the game). For example, while GTA is an open world which doesn't really change no matter what you do (well, drastically speaking), in Mafia II when you reach a certain part of the story and decide to move forward, the whole environment around changes, which is something that can catch the player off guard (such as I). In other words, we're talking about an open world game that it's directly influenced by the story's linearity (if that makes any sense). Apart from that, the graphics, music and sound effects are quite cool. As for the replay value, I wonder if I'll ever play this game again in the future but it's definitely really fun and I recommend it to everyone.",1,0

You can tailor your characters to your preference -- either stealthy, tough and heavily armed or a mix of both.

4279461,329490,Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds,"Whoever calls this an 8-bit game again will get slapped.  If you cannot tell by the pictures, do not worry, this is a 32-bit retro styled game.  This will bring you back to the great eras of the Arcade/Snes/Sega-Genesis beat-em-ups  If you have played games like Castle Crashers or Scott Pilgrim vs the World (for the consoles), this is highly similar. We are talking about a crossover between beat-em-up and rpg. However this game is a 2 laned beat em up, not a free moving one; so if you have ever played Guardian Heroes then the gameplay is basically like that. Its really cool and well done, and with some friends included, this game can take up a lot of your time. You start out with 4 characters, and you unlock more as you go (I believe 4 more). They are all female except one dude who you unlock all the way at the end, so if you do not like playing as female characters (you sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) then this game is not for you.  I am very disappointed that the developers did not decide to implement the online feature such as in the console version (360). So yes, WARNING! THIS IS A LOCAL ONLY GAME. This still does not bring down the game, and I really do hope with the inclusion of the dlc at one point, developers will include online support.  TLDR: Is this game worth a buy? Depends, do you like Castle Crashers? Double Dragon? Final Fight? Anime School Girls with weapons? Then yes.",1,1

3402976,279260,Richard & Alice,"So, this was an overwhelming emotional story in an underwhelming technically sluggish game. Not what I was expecting.  Is it worth it? If you have the patience to beat the game (or at least to get the best ending 'Nothing's Changed'), then yes, it is.    Richard and Alice  is about morals in a dystopian world. Yes, there have been many movies or games about this topic, but the difference it in how they present it and how much time is left/ time has passed until/since humanity’s downfall. In this case its weather, particularly snow that is what destroys the majority of society and from what remains come survivors and how much they will lose as humans to survive.  In that sense it is very similar to the   Walking Dead,   but   Richard and Alice  cleverly tells it is story through flashbacks and current events reflecting on the tragedies that occurred during that time. This game knows how to be a quiet storyteller. There’s no voice acting and only the quiet text with subtle background music/sound effects to tell it. This lets the moral message and emotional moments hit hard without any worry of a bad vocal performance. You take in and understand the events and when you imagine how these scenarios would sound in a movie dialogue, the quality of the writing really stands out.  The main problem is the gameplay, specifically the game engine. Now   Adventure Game Studio   has been used to make some outstanding games (ex.   The Blackwell Legacy   series), but this game suffers from sluggish movement in the big open environments and it drags when you just want the next bit of quality story info (at least on my fastest computer with a high graphics card). Also, the items are too small for the mouse cursor to pick up unless you are dead on accurate. Not to mention that the item menu makes movement in a certain direction difficult. It needed a visual overhaul, but on the other hand the lack of quality visuals makes some of the more horrific scenes bearable and leaves more to the imagination. So while it served its purpose for   Owl Cave’s   first major release.  Overall, this game is a beautifully emotional novelette with five endings (my favourite is listed above) wrapped in a slow-paced adventure game (by my standards after   Blackwell).   So if you can spare about three to five hours with a walkthrough guide, you will have a story that would make a good comic comparable to the   Walking Dead.   If nothing else they have the rare skill to use limited visuals tell a beautiful story. It might test your patience, but it is worth it.  And look forward to their upcoming title   Location Services.  ",1,0
5035831,386970,Memory's Dogma CODE:01,"This game is really very good. It is so good that from the bottom of the heart you want it to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it is not ('just' solid 9/10). Nevertheless, it is one of the best visual novels I played. It has very good climate. I felt protagonist, characters and story. This novel at one point quite abruptly detracts from what some call 'hard science fiction' and introduces 'fantasy' elements (justified within the world's science... yet still a little striking). It was the first sign that it will not be so philosophical as I hoped it to be.  Soundtrack was ideal in my opinnion. Creepy when it needed to be and melancholic when it needed to be. I love static (as in 'radio static') motives and similar (I lack words to better call it). Visuals also. Artists have done really great job.  I managed to end the game without bad ends in the first run (but I was in a constant doubt if my choices were good, which I absolutely loved!), and because of that I had a feeling that game has really very much to offer because I was really curious what would happen, if I have made other choices. I was kind of surprised that ... not much. Really, if you hope for routes for different heroines, stop (unless I missed something, but it's not likely). There is de facto route for only one heroine (also the best one :)). I have a feeling that producers had ambitions for distinct routes for every 'heroine', but quality and time limitations prevented this. The duo from the novel should have got more screentime. Also, all choices in the game are timed. This surprised me in the beginning, but now I want this system in all novels I will play from now on. I noticed it makes you go for decision which is most true with you, instead of those meta-game consideration we all know to well. It makes you more engaged.   Final remarks: for me this game was more absorbing than Fate/Stay Night visual novel and felt a little similar during play. I have impression that authors had taken some inspirations from Fate and also from series such as Serial Experiments Lain. ",1,0

Watch dogs has many things to do besides the campaign, there is mini games, side missions and multiplayer. Watch dogs is very fun for sure and I love the combat in the missions and using your surroundings to your advantage. The only thing that I found that my PC struggled with was sometimes I'd drop big frames while driving fast. Ubisoft also has a sense of humor, when profiling some people on the street, it says some really hilarious stuff such as 'sexually atracted to musical instruments' for one guy XD.

This game doesn't take itself as serious as GTA, and I think thats where Saints Row 2 gets its charm. It isn't focused on the 'pure storyline' even though it can get intense at times. This game is meant to be taken less seriously and focuses on being entertaining and being fun, and I think it achieves at both while your in the hood!  If you want a Entertaining, Interesting Open World to mess around, and have plenty of Main &amp; Side missions, while in a gangster theme, get this game. The only real problem with this game is the port, the game will get laggy in large shootouts and if your going fast in a car, still a playable and great game though.   (7/10) Please buy this game and kill a gang in your underwear",1,0
591927,204300,Awesomenauts,"So before i even got the Pc version i played the Xbox 360 version it easily became my favourite game even if it was never to be updated. everything was pretty balanced with the semi small pool of characters. spent hours with friends battling it out and having a blast finally got the Pc version and was blown away with the vast amount of characters to play with and how many people played. friends got me into a dif game and stopped playing for awhile Hopped on after not playing for a good month join a game and am messing up decently team mate starts talking crap about me and the other dude on the team killing the fun vibe that was there we end up winning  guy says he did everything when in reality it was a team effort join another game same situation happens again...and again....and again this game would be really fun if only there were less toxic people like that but sadly that isnt the case.  wonderful game, needs some balancing, so many fun characters, art is awesome but that all isnt even worth mentioning if the community is horrible Only buy this game on sale or if your friends want you to get it.  played with friends and it is the most fun ive had in the longest time i give a 5/10 but only because the community is terrible if it wasnt 100% 10/10 ",-1,0

It's a universe simulator, quite obviously, where you take a pre-existing area in space and change whatever variables you want. Watch the subtle effects on the rest of the solar system as you place another earth in orbit, or anything like that.  Yet, if I had to describe this game in one word, it would be; Hilarious.  Increase the Gravitational Constant to several million billion times its current value, then watch all the planets freak out and run away from each other.  Best of all is the collision. One of the settings makes it so that when two objects collide, the bigger absorbs the smaller, gaining its mass.  This is the only game in which I have, or could concievably dream of, encountering the following scenario.  I threw Earths at my enlarged Mega-Earth to make it bigger, but I threw too many Earths that they formed their own Mega-Earth, absorbing the first one. And I was okay with it, because wut.",1,0

First game I ever played though was of Wasteland and I met up with on guy who quickly made a group with me and we went driving around in a boat trying to get to a heli crash, opposed by a sniper on a hill about 1km out, and in the dead of night... that was quite fun. Now I spend my time playing Battle Royale and building a base in Epoch, which is still great fun but I still recommend getting a group of guys or girls together to get the most out of this. Walking simulator? Definitely, but if you ask anyone they will probably say that it is offset by the overwelming sense of adrenaline when you come across an enemy. I should add that this 'game' isn't meant to be fun, if anything it's exhilerating as it's a 'war simulator' not a game and makes you feel as if it's your own life instead.",1,0

4969192,382490,Relic Hunters Zero: Remix,"Pixel style games are making a comeback, and when a game uses this principle and manages to still be fun is a welcome game to me.  Relic Hunters Zero is entertaining as an arcade style of game. It's simplistic gameplay, loads of collectibles and agreeable challenge factor give it major bonus points.  I find that some of the weapons are difficult to use, especially my go-to in shooters, the sniper rifle. I find that it's range is not at all what it could be, which is disappointing for anyone that wants to take enemies out from afar.  Also, the game's overall story is built on very little backstory, as if you are tossed into a fight that you have no idea is going on. This takes away from the interest, as I'm left questioning what is going on at all times.  That being said, what this game lacks in story is made up for in its charming and fun style of gameplay. This 2D shooter lets you roam through a variety of areas with a loadout of your choice, and you can either take out your enemies quietly or blow them to smithereens, taking the terrain with you.  Final verdict, Relic Hunters Zero is a good game all and all, because its fun and it has a bit of charm to it. The collection feature is a great way to boost playtime. It may lack in a few areas, but it makes up for them well enough that it doesn't matter. I can destroy my enemies and the whole world as I please! Mwahahaha!  Final Mark: 3/5 stars",1,0

4104961,317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"Haven't done any of these little review/commentary on games in a little while but thought i would do this nice little indie game, as above its called the ' Guild of dungeoneering '. Its a nice little hand drawn style with an amazing narrator and music style particularly if you like that Terry Pratchett style i find it quite similar to that.  Its a quite interesting little RPG Rouge lite kind of game without any broad skill trees or anything like that, abilities are gained through equipment and combat is also done in a interesting fashion.  So the game is done in a card based fashion, with two main components the building of the dungeon and the combat with the creatures in it. So the building of the dungeon is done in a randomized card fashion pullying cards from a deck specified for the level by the designer (so far into the game you cannot alter this deck); these include room card such as a corridors, turns and rooms with multiple exits. The other type of room save the specific paths you can create are rooms with 'fountains' these come in the entire variety of room designs but also come with a fountain in the middle of the room, the fountains give buff or debuff to the character, but is only picked up after killing any monsters in the room, these have a wide range of effects such as 'burn', 'stupidity', 'blindness', 'fury' or such as +1 hand size or +1 loot, i will explain what this means later in the combat.  Next is monsters cards depending on the level of your character, they are given to the player and allow you to place them as you like: though note that killing these monsters are needed for gold and loot so you want to be fighting as much as you can.  The final set of cards is one of the more interesting mechanics 'gold' in this game you don't directly control your characters they go where they please depending on where the paths you make go, or where the gold is. With the placement of gold or other treasures you can lure your adventurous little scamps down the path to victory, but with a lack of incentive your hero will often run of on their own attacking monsters at will sometimes this is fine allowing them to kill everything in sight can be good for loot but some monster are more of a challenge than others or for you character to go to or avoid 'fountains'.  The combat is one of the other interesting ideas in this game its done in a card based method, most characters have a starting hand size of 3 cards when the fight begins (if not under effect of buff which increases it), these cards come in many different varieties, but the main idea is each player plays a card and it is resolved and removed. Most will deal damage to the opposite side these come in two varieties magic (blue) and physical (red) these two styles of damage are important when it comes to blocking and the resolution of certain effects, but as an overarching comment blue can only block blue just as red can only block red. So I will basically explain the combat; the player gets to chose a card from their hand (note in most cases you are reacting to the opponent's card unless your under the blindness debuff where their card is hidden), one such card is the bruisers 'get out of here' which is one red damage and one red block, which can be used to deal one damage and block one physical damage. Along with the various damage and blocking card there are cards which allow the drawing of extra cards along with other cards which can give damage when you next use a specific attack or healing abilities.  As to buff and debuffs there is quite a variety, 'burn' causes one damage per round on both enemy and character, 'blindness' prevents you seeing and reacting to them, others include frenzy which activates when the character or enemy is below half health and it causes physical attacks to have +1 damage. Or for the debuff 'mundane' causes magic atracks to do down +1 damage to the enemy or 'stupidity' which give an extra card a 'stupid' or 'umm' which are a blank card which obviously aren't good for combat, or at least takes up a spot in your hand.   The RPG/rouge lite effects of the game are quite interesting, at the start of each dungeon run or mission the character starts again at level 1 without any equipment, death has no real problem it just means you loose most of the loot and gold you gathered. As you fight through the level you will kill monsters and level up which cause an increase in health and for each kill you gain an option for selection of equipment which give the options for 3 different cards to the combat but this can be altered with certain abilities to give more cards. Overall you can equip 4 peices of equipment a helm/hat, main hand, offhand and a body: the equipment gives many options as i mentioned before which include extra health or extra cards for combat.  Apart from the dungeoneering you also have a small peice of base building in the form of the guild, this is where you spend your hard earned gold, you build buildings which either give other variations of heros or gives options for better gear to be found in the dungeons these are in three teirs initally which goes at the costs of 50/500/2000 gold.  Overall its a good little game and now they have actually recently released a DLC for additional dungeons to explore along with additional character you can play, i certainly think its a good little game, worth a look at if you have the time Its well worth it.",1,0

Has an extremely good free to play model The combat is very well done: Skill effects look badass and it's impacts are very satisfying The end game items are unique and not just an overall improved stat clone of an item Community is actually very nice, occasionally high level people will join your party simply to help, and there's even the occasional free items in global chat  NEUTRAL (i.e. can be pro or a con) Has a very dark, gritty setting and has a lot of gore Heavily RNG based when it comes down to item drops, sockets, links, and the stats of rare or unique items Has random generated maps  CONS Hard to get into at first due to it's somewhat weak early game The mobs have a basic AI system, where they chase you, and occasionally you find a monster with added effects that can use certain skills. The bosses in the main story are extremely basic as well. An example of what a good boss fight is would be Diablo 3's bosses. Has a very limited graphics customization, actually requiring to edit the codes manuall if you wish to edit your graphics further. The 1 v 1, or CTFs have horrible matchmakings, only providing a level range matchmaking for level 28s and below, while after 28, almost everyone is 70+ and you can't even dare hope to queue up unless you have a death wish, or you're a high enough level  ",1,0

Then avoid Hitman: Absolution like the plague, because it's really not like any of its predecessors. Admittedly, it's visually beautiful, with a new game engine and detailed models and textures, and the voice cast alone has some legendary actors featured.  However, the levels are small and linear. The plot is weak beyond belief, as is the dialogue - it feels like a bunch of 14 year old boys tried to write a Tarantino movie. It's truly dreadful, it'll make you angry just watching the cutscenes. NPC speech trying sooo hard to be edgy... constant tiresome unfunny jokes - GTA has a LOT to answer for - or how someone's a b*tch - you wonder if one of the principal writers had recently gone through a messy divorce, so toxic is the game's treatment of women (they're almost entirely either stupid/hateful/shrewish/strippers/sex toys/victims). The few people who actually cared about Kane &amp; Lynch, IO's other notable game series, will notice a cameo, and it's telling that those seconds with a well-drawn character throw into sharp relief just how utterly cliched and two-dimensional the cast are in H:A. I actually felt embarrassed for David Carradine and Powers Boothe for having to spout the inane bilge that passes for writing.  Even 47 has a contrived and inauthentic-feeling moral epiphany forced on him - this is the man who'll strangle a party clown just to take his clothes as a disguise, suddenly deciding he's going to go against his contract. The story wanders around in a flabby circle, goes nowhere interesting, and ends with an incredibly weak 'twist'  TL:DR - Utter rubbish. Avoid.",-1,0

Just keep in mind that hunting gets more productive as you extend the range of your archers by cutting down trees. Don't rush extending and building, BUT - destroy some trees to the left and give the archers some extra space for hunting. The only downside is that they sometimes return too late to the camp (= don't return at all). And keep in mind that destroying the last tree by a 'human camp' – destroys the camp itself.",1,0

4907674,378120,Football Manager 2016,"I have been playing this game since the days of CM, there are very few editions. if any that I haven't bought and played.  It's a shame that I have to say FM 2016 is the worst edition of the game I have ever played. I have put in a lot of hours but it just gets too much when you are watching a match engine that is totally awful.  It seems designed to stop good sides winning too many games by too many goals, so deliberatly will make world class players slam the ball into the post from a tight angle constantly when all he has to do is roll it to the players in the middle. Head the ball inside the 6 yard box? Crossbar or post, guarenteed.  Opposition GK's putting in world class performances, making half a dozen world class saves, on top of all those times you hit the post from 1 yard and he gets a rating of 6.6.  Crosses are totally over powered, get a decent cross in the oppo will score everytime, you do it you will score a heck of a lot, but that's where the world class saves start coming in.  Players go off on international duty? Here, have him back injured for the next 8 weeks!  The only way defenders get good ratings is if they score.  Really, so little effort seems to have gone into this edition it puts me off parting with my £35 for the next one.  TLDR - Match engine is shockingly bad, don't waste your money.",-1,1

I was very disappointed at the lack of defensive structures in the game, since I enjoy fortifying strategic points. I was also disappointed at the lack of units such as recon motorcycles etc. and honestly thought they were going to add more units/structures down the line, but they haven't.

5736165,47780,Dead Space 2,"Bite Size Review - Dead Space 2 (hey that ryhmes!)  The Good: +Graphics +Weapon Options +Enemy Variety +Level Design and Exploration  +Gameplay is very satisfying +Type of game you want to play until the very end  The Bad: -Not Really Scarey after the first 20 minutes -Game is more action oriented than survival Horror -Story is nothing special (alien artifact turns everyone except you into a monster) -Characters other than you are not memorable -Not a whole lot of replay value   The Verdict:  I have been a big fan of the Dead Space series and have really enjoyed it since the first one. This game improves on the first one in a good amount of ways - introducing more enemy types and more gun types to outfit Izac with. I will say this though, this game is not scarey, not at all. Also the story, is really there to just break up the combat a bit, none of the characters or story elements are that vital to the enjoyment of this game.   This game in my mind is what a modern day DOOM should be. Really. It's feels very much like that and if you go into the game with the mindset of this being a slow paced, thinking-man's DOOM, you can really have a fun time with it.",1,0

519272,202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"Ok. This game has been one of my most favorite games ever. The Campaign had multiple endings,(which made me want to unlock each ending) The multiplayer was extremely fun. I really liked the customization packs with weapon skins and such. i do not own all of them, but i wish. They are just too expensive for a weapon skin, like c'mon!. Anyway, now to the zombies. The zombies were the most unique aspect of this game. the zombies storyline went from quite literally all around the world, from the U.S.A. all the way to Germany, Europe. My favorite zombie map had to be Mob of The Dead, because it had so many tasks which are hard to find at first, but with only 1 hour of searching the internet for answers,they will appear to be right in front of you. Overall, to me this game would be a solid 16.433/10. Good Job Treyarch, you did an excellent on this one.",1,0

2282010,241560,The Crew,"I Pre-Ordered this game (complete with DLC Season Pass), thinking it would be the 'killer app' for NFS. I also had the opportunity to get access to a weeklong beta preview (which I did a few videos on). The first three days of its release, I streamed all my gameplay on Twitch - that later got ported over to Youtube. I thought this game was awesome, the sh!t, the bomb, whatever.  I was wrong.  Three days of gaming, and I had already beaten the campaign, made it to Level 50 (which is the maximum level you can reach), and complained like a motherf*cker about how bad it was. Police chases were impossible (they used to be easy in the beta, they turned into brick walls in the release), the handling was so off that you're forced to use AWD vehicles to win (looking at you, mountain missions!), and so many classes for cars were missing (back then, the Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R just had Street, Dirt and Performance specs), and the rubberbanding was stupidly ridiculous. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that Perf-Spec Hummers could wipe the floor with most other cars.  And then...Wild Run came out.  And made everything worse.  Getting Platinum no longer meant that you had a random chance of getting parts from Lv. 40-50, but now you had a chance to get visuals from Platinum wins, too. This means bumpers, spoilers, car colours, vinyls, stickers, rims, and more - all battling against a performance part that's just 1 level above what you currently have.  Car physics went even more awry than before - I used to be able to drift on the mountains fine with my Perf-Spec R34, but now I can do it with my Circuit-Spec R34, instead.  Wild Run brought specs to vehicles that have no right for them - I mean, who even wants a Monster Truck version of a Skyline R34? Or any sedan/coupe? Isn't that spec supposed to be for, y'know, trucks?  And then the Bikes - basically everyone uses them in PvP. And with smaller hitboxes and more torque than even supercars, they're guaranteed to win every match. It's not fun anymore.  I don't hop on the game anymore, and I wonder why I keep it installed. I guess some part of me holds a small bit of hope that the right people will come along, and make the game what it was meant to be, instead of this crazy clusterf*ck that it currently is.  All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone, regardless of sale price. Just don't bother.   EDIT: I would also like to add, that since Wild Run's release, there have been game-breaking bugs that Ubisoft has refused to take responsibility for, and has only gotten worse in recent months.",-1,1

I was a little dubious to begin with thinking no re-make (and a few have been attempted the 'UFO trilogy') would stand up to the original. Aspects such as squad creation and progression down to tech research and engineering all are standard formats most people know, but crafted alongside a great alien invasion story and turn based tactics I would say its a must buy for anyone into strategy games with RPG elements. For those who recall the original and are wondering what is missing, main aspects are multiple base creation, allocating equipment Deus Ex style alongside more specific equipment slots. Also aspects such as squad members becoming more accurate with certain weapons the more they used them to a standard aim ability, and a limit to high ranking soldiers based on the number of soldiers you had in anyone base. But overall these are minor issues compared to new aspects of the game not in the original. I hope this review has been of some help to gamers out there!",1,0

5425187,420440,Atlantic Fleet,"I bought this on an impulse, as it was cheap, featured WWII naval combat, and looked pretty good. My first impression is not all that great, however. Putting shots on target is a lot more hit and miss than it feels it ought to be. In-game estimates meant to help you with this are often wildly off the mark, making combat rather frustrating. Also, I find I have a bit of trouble keeping track of the battlefield during night battles, as there are no interface prompts or icons that let you know which of the ships are yours and which are enemies (on the map, yes, but in 3D mode not so much).   I need more time to come to grips with this game, but even as a cheap impulse purchase I am not overly happy. I was hoping for an off-line alternative for World of Warships, but this offers a lot less satisfaction/hour than WoWS.  At this stage I am neither recommending this game, nor am I saying you should not buy it if you are into WWII naval combat. I will say that it isn't a very intuitive game, and had me frustrated in under 15 minutes. I want to like it, I just don't. Not yet, at least.",-1,1

I don't see much potential.   There is very little depth to the building your office. In some way it adds some more expanse to the game, with the ability to make multiple games, but managements quickly becomes unruly, especially when working with the graphics studio, sound studio, and etc. If you develop your own engine, then your game will often be interupted by other studios releasing crap. Icons also sometimes additionally get in the way of what you want to work at. The game doesn't give the player much feedback and so it is difficult to judge how to improve things.

4612495,35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad is one of the most realistic shooters I have played, it differs from other shooters I played like Call of Duty and Battlefield by its realistic aspects, like for example when you get shot in the chest, you're dead, no second chances, just like in real life and its unforgiving, and I like that, since you're always on the look, moving inch by inch, always having the nerve if there's an enemy with a sniper on the window, or a tank that might have saw you, its aspects like this that tell you to try to stay alive than rather go out guns blazing because if you do, then get ready for a whole bunch of deaths, and its fun, but its always infinitely more fun when you work with your team to try to win, communicating and planning to what to do next and it gives you feeling how a real war would look like, though I will say, if you're a player that likes Call of Duty a lot, you might not wanna buy this game, first this game is increasingly difficult, and second its very complicated, but if you like strategy games like me, then try to this one out.",1,0

2972498,258970,Gauntlet™ ,"We were looking for a co-op game to play with out of town family, and when we found Gauntlet it was the perfect fit. This was a casual game that we could play once a week for an evening, and something that even my (non-gamer) wife could, and did, enjoy with us. The game was short, but even after completing it we could mix up the characters that we played or increase the masteries of our favorite class. This was our favorite game.  When we saw that the game had been given some love, we looked forward to a little polishing and even hoped for additional levels. Unfortunately, what we got was some graphics polishing that added odd stutter and erratic movements to the display, deterioration of the camera control, and the removal of the RPG element of character advancement through the abilities improved through masteries. Worse of all for our players was the elimination of “endless lives” when in a group (easy and normal difficulty prior to the patch), which had allowed the most casual to enjoy the game; those players are no longer interested in playing. So, please bring this back in some form, maybe just to the easy difficulty level, or as an option in the game setup for the host (these scores do not need to be included in the leaderboards – some of us just want to allow more people to enjoy the game and not just try to game the high score).   Sadly, I can no longer recommend this game. ",-1,0

6175377,63380,Sniper Elite V2,"I just finished the game and I felt inclined to give a review and I would like to say now that I rate it some where around 8/10. The story is kind of dull and the missions are hard but the graphics and the bullet ballistics are amazing in my opinion. You can argue that the graphics aren't great but I am not one who is pampered by amazingly graphical games such as AC black flag and Watch dogs. I also really enjoy the bullet cam and the x-ray bullet views. There are not many missions but they are long and tedious and you can't save when ever you wan't and that adds extra challenge. The stealth feature is okay but I found myself not using it often as I kept getting spotted so I can't give a review on that.  The story line is that you're a sniper in WW2 with the task of eliminating V2 rocket scientists. You battle through many locations of germany with a variety of rifles, pistols, smgs, and choices between trip mines and a few other traps and gadgets. For 30$ I am not so sure if its worth it but 20$ is my price range. Again I rate 8/10 because it's great but not perfect.  EDIT: I would like to add you can shoot testicles out 10/10.",1,0

If you're trying to find that game that is just the right combination of RPG, strategy, and warfare, this is the game for you. This one hit the spot and I hope that there will be more games just like it.  If I had to say anything negative about the game, and I'm loathe to do so, then I'd mention that its graphics are not quite on par with other titles. To be clear, this doesn't mean that they are bad, exactly but that they are just not as good as other titles.  I'd also mention that, while the game does all three of the aforementioned genres (RPG, Strategy, and Warfare) very well, it is not perfect in any of them. It has elements from all of them, but if you want to play an excellent strategy game, you will have to go else- where (Any Paradox title, Civilization, or Total War). If you want an excellent RPG then you will want to buy such titles as Dark Souls, The Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age... etc (the list is long), and if you want something that is more focused on the warfare elements that appear in this game, I'd recommend the Dynasty warriors series. In short, the game has elements of all of these genres, but isn't the best representative of any of them.  I hope they keep improving and release another one. Awesome game.",1,0

5165708,39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Yes. Would recommend/10.  It's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination and the main gripes that people may have with the game include how character progression via quests is 'one-time'. Normally this would be perfectly normal but in FF14, one character can achieve max level in every single class. Quests are not non-exhaustive which leads to an inevitable dungeon and FATE (world event) grind. Also, the global cooldown is also 2.5 seconds which may feel extremely slow paced to people more used to 1 second GCDs or 'reactive' games such as Guild Wars 2. Also, subscriptions.  I also think it is worth mentioning that if you live in non-NA/EU/JP regions (e.g. Oceania) you will have to play with a moderate-high amount of latency (150~400ms) which may frustrate you in certain dungeon/raid instances.  With all that said, all classes, jobs and crafting professions play very differently to each other which adds a lot of variety in the game. The plot is actually cohesive and builds up to quite a climax over time if you're into storyline. Dungeons and raids can be extremely challenging (RIP SCoB Savage Mode) And heck, it's Final Fantasy.  If you have the time, money and friends to play the game with, it will be a pleasant experience. Just remember to join a Free Company (guilds) as soon as you can - buffs, new friends and always someone to talk to (freebies may be included).   P.S.

2268993,241260,Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,"I like Detective/Murder/Mystery type games and am quite a fan of Sherlock Holmes in general, so it was no surprise that I enjoyed my time playing through this game. After having played through most of the Sherlock Holmes games I also like the direction the developers seem to be taking this series. This last installment is certainly my favorite of all I've played so far, but it is of course not without its issues.  First, I want to mention that the graphics are quite gorgeous in this game, and in several instances I found myself just gazing on the terrifically detailed and beautiful locales. Also the characters themselves are highly detailed and I sit left quite impressed. I did however find most areas a bit 'foggy' and also animations not equally impressive. Close up of faces looks stunning, but feel stiff and lifeless.  As with the previous game, the voice acting is top notch and every character you play and meet are believable. I had a bit of trouble hearing the voices of our Baker Street duo in the beginning as voices seemed to be set quite low, but it was easily adjusted through the options screen. Music and sound effects throughout the game seemed very good.  All those things are good to have and helps the immersion and the general enjoyment of the game, but it all comes down to how the game plays. I know that this won't be a game for everyone. It is slow paced, dialog heavy and a lot of traveling back and forth, and for people who like their action a bit revved up this game will have a hard time to convince that it is worth their time. However, if you are into good story telling, enjoy having to think a little and don't mind lots of dialog then this right here is quite a gem. It will of course help if you share my interest in Detective/Murder/Mystery previously mentioned.  The game is seperated into six seperate cases of a little varied lengths and difficulty. They are all interesting mysteries with added twists and appear in well varied and interesting locales. They are truly seperate cases and are not smaller parts of a bigger scheme. I like that setup. It feels like they were going for an episode based game but you get all of it in one dash. Felt good to end one case one day, and then start a fresh new one the next. Kept it constantly interesting.  It is not a particularly difficult or challenging game. It felt more like a guided experience where you in the end decide who the culprit is and his or her fate. You do this through a deduction minigame that you constantly add to as you uncover clues and statements. In the end you can be totally wrong and have an innocent person thrown in jail. So you need to pay attention.  The game has a few various puzzle mini games and quick time events that give good variation to the gameplay even though the QTE's feel a bit out of place. You also have some 'super' abilities that you need to use certain places. But don't worry you will not miss anything as you will always be notified when you need to use them.  I like that they put in some references to previous games in the series and also a nod to other things. The Calvin &amp; Hobbes reference was particularly enjoyable :o)  Because the game is split up the way it is it seemed like a lengthy game for an adventure type game and I spent about 18 hrs to play through it. Even though it felt too easy and too guided I feel like I really got my money's worth in entertainment from this game.  The biggest complaint I have is that they have reduced Dr. Watson to a walking, talking obstacle that just seems to be in the way, and contributes nothing. Surely there would be ways to include him in various ways for a fuller experience?  In the end I have to say that I would easily recommend this game to all Sherlock fans, adventure game fans, murder/mystery fans and similar gamers.  I give this game a 8/10  Happy gaming!

5040345,38740,EDGE,"I played the 3DS version before finding out this was on Steam. I remember playing various Q*Bert games when I was younger, so the isometric view and controls was nostalgic for me. But combine that with the blocky theme and retro aethetic, as well as some really cool music, and I was hooked on what I'd call the funnest puzzle platformer I've played since Portal. Two Tribes does not disappoint here. Edge is incredibly fun and addictive, and I found myself laughing and praising the game when I was tricked by some of the levels, rather than getting frustrated and raging. If I had one gripe, it'd be that I was kinda sad to see the Steam version doesn't have a level editor and Workshop support. But even so, it's totally worth checking out for a fun puzzle platforming experience.",1,0

625518,204880,Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion,"I'd strongly recommend Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion to anyone who enjoys strategy games. It bills itself as an RT4X, a realtime 4X game (4X usually being like Civilization). For an RTS, Sins is relatively slow paced, but that is not a bad thing, considering the massive scale maps can be spread out across. Some of the largest maps are five star systems with over 150 different gravity wells. The scale is never overwhelming, however, thanks to the good UI for Sins, and a smart zoon feature that can zoom to your cursor with a flick of the mouse wheel.  Sins is also an example of a game with three factions that superficially have similar tech trees and units, but in fact are vastly different. At the start of a game, all the factions seem similar; it's not until you've researched most of the techs in a game, however, that the faction differences become apparant. The TEC, for example, gets the best economy at the end of the game and the thickest arm,or, while the Advent get some of the best culture bonuses and shielding, while the Vasari are experts at navigating space.  Simply put, it can take hours to finish the largest maps. One map took me about 12 hours to get a victory screen for. And the scale of the space battles can also be awe inspiring, with Titans and capital ships brwaling it out as frigates, corvettes, and cruisers support them, and nimble strike craft swoop through the formations.   For a game with a four year old graphics engine, as well, Rebellion looks gorgeous, with nice details on the various ships, shadows cast on them, and small details such as solar flares on the stars in the game, dots of light on a planets surface, and more. All in all, I would say that Sins is worth the price, and any lover of strategy will enjoy the game immensely.",1,0

1216149,219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I love this game, except for it's tutorial, which has quite a few very bothering bugs. Thankfully the tutorial is not very long (altough kind of essential), and the multiplayer is excellent, solid, beautiful, very very fun, and can be quite funny too. I just wish sometimes the player would stop spamming the screams, and also that the DLC would have team objective games / maps just like in the original.  I recommend Chivalry Medieval Warfare to anyone who likes multiplayer fps (altough the S in fps here means more slasher than shooter ?) Anyways....  On the other hand, I'd recommend Dealiest Warrior only to the people who want to have fun with classic fantasy roles like ninjas, pirates and so on, and that strictly like the fighting part, because the games can get boring quite fast if you'd like to complete objectives to make your team advance in the next part of the map and such... But it's still awesome, fun, solid, not buggy, etc, it's just the lack of Team Objective Game Modes is a big deception to me.",1,0

While this game has no replay value, it still provides a decent one-time experience that may (or may not) be remembered. In the 2hrs that I've spent playing, I was sure to go through all of the options available to me; no matter what I said or did, I got the same end. And while I enjoyed my first playthrough for what it was, the ending was rather disappointing, despite being realistic. Emily was kind of....meh. I didn't care much for her character, particularly because she couldn't make up her mind for anything, so she got annoying really fast. I wish I could've talked to Emma, she would've been worth my time. If the game ever gets an update for different endings, I will definitely play it again.

4651287,358750,Sunrider: Liberation Day - Captain's Edition,"Reviewer backstory: I had first come upon the Sunrider series back when the first game was just recently released on Steam. I had instantly become enamored when I first finished and was excited to see more as I became interested in all the characters. (Solamancer btw) After MoA and Academy I was excited for this game Liberation day, it had sent me into Mass Effect 3 frenzy all over again. I became a Patreon supporter so that I could get Beta access and have a copy of the game reserved at launch!   Game Review: Ver1 was a bitter experience for myself. This mediocre version of the game had completely neglected the story and its paltry choices left me dumbfounded. While the gameplay by itself was well done and the Japanese voice acting was impressive, that too was hampered by slowdown from the new game engine. A final note is that I am one of those who run through on waifu mode because I'm more interested in the story aspects which Ver1 stumbled on at the end with a seemingly fatalistic ending and railroaded relationship with your science officer.  Ver2 largely retained the gameplay features with a few bug fixes but its main contribution was the addition of an epilogue to reintroduce choices into the game and to show that this was not your character's final act but simply a chapter closed and a new foe to face.  The DLC: I write this review after having played REborn and this was the best part of the game by far in terms of choices and story as it now allowed choices to create unique paths and reach new endings. The game would always encourage you to try again if you reached a bad ending or even aim higher if you reached the 'normal/alt' endings. It was worth a bad ending or two to figure out the secret to getting the good endings. (Thanks Wanderer!}  Sola love!  All in all it was a pleasant experience in the end. Here's to leaving Ver1 behind and seeing the future of this series!",1,1

1650943,225320,Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft,"Tomb Raider III is argueably one of the best of the series as it gives so much more. An example of this is once you complete the area you are in, you have the freedom to go where you wish to next. The puzzles are very well thought out, and require you to either be quick or make no mistake, and with the return of quite a few classic enemies, weapons and mechanics, e.g losing your weapons, even secrets. One thing i don't really like with this game is that the controls are kinda sluggish, but get past that little problem and this game is worth the buy. this is for those who love action, with a healthy dose puzzles and brainteasers  all in all, i give this game an 8/10",1,0

6270315,7670,BioShock,"I started playing the game, gave it a break after a first few moments of frustration to start again several months later. About 20 mins later I uninstalled the whole game.  It didn't manage to get me involved past the nicely done opening scene. Basically it is a very clunky shoot-em-up, which tries to sell itself as a novel approach to first-person games. But the plot is annoyingly simple and badly told (of course the horrible German translation plays its part at ruining the overall atmosphere as well).   The persons in the game are completely overdone, lacking any credibility for what they are doing. It might have been the intention of the developers to outline the failure of the underwater model society by displaying the hypocricy and hybris of its inhabitants, but that doesn't really help in explaining why everyone is just attacking at plain sight. The clicheed slaughterhouse horror scene don't really help it either, they torpedo every subtle approach of telling an intelligent narrative.  To cut a long story short, I really didn't like it. In my opinion the developers failed at their attempt to tell a story in a FPS action game. They wallowed in cheap horror clichees and the united gaming press once more hyped it beyond reason.  It's neither a good action game, nor a game which delivers a compelling narrative, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",-1,0

It is more like what I would expect from someone who was taking a course on RPG Maker and banged something out really quick as a homework assignment. It is a quaint little demo of some of the most basic things RPG maker is capable of. It is the software equivalent of plastic display food: you will see some things that will put you in mind of a RPG, but if you try to partake you will quickly realize there is no point. One of the only reasons I finished this thing was because of a constant nagging feeling of 'Surely there must be more to it than this?'  Hit: passable story writing, lovely artwork in the steam store, sprint button, easily exploitable mechanics for circumventing the mind numbing combat, and thank god it was short.  Miss: what little story the game has is stretched beyond reason and told poorly, excessive flashback sequences, sloppy coding, poorly designed (read:ABSENT) gameplay, only 11 types of enemies (including bosses) in the entire game, shallow characters, misleading promotional artwork, ubiquitous artificial game lengthening grind, and more boring than watching a robot play the original final fantasy in a language you can't read.

Some tips:  Avoid saving over old save files, this can RARELY cause corrupted saves; not common by any means but annoying enough to be worth avoiding.  Be ready to manage your own businesses in the early game; I've seen a lot of people set them to AI controlled and then get confused when they can't get ahead money-wise. The AI controlled setting has an upkeep you pay every turn. Be sure to download the newest patch (4.211 as of 11/15/15) by enabling betas through Steam!  Good luck, and enjoy the game :)",1,0

Choices don't matter (as always) and there is no ending. Graphics are awful and backgrounds are ridiculous. Game fails on every front. The only good thing is voice acting. P.S.

Includes events, gangs and even an escape mode which allows you to escape your prison or someone elses .  The graphics are good for the type of game it was designed for (2-D surface with some 3-D objects above that). It is very addictive and captures a wide range of emotions.

3215330,269650,Dex,"Been wanting to check this one out for quite some time as I love games with cyberpunk/science fiction themes, I got this during a sale for 4,99€.   And all in all Dex was a pretty fun game! It's a nice little 2D rpg set in a classic cyberpunk vision of the future.  Exploration of the open world is one focus of the game and one it does well with gorgeous, atmospheric backgrounds and lots of secrets and quests to be found. The compellingly-written world, quests and story missions usually can be approached in a variety of ways. I played as charming hacker, evading fights when possible until I got strong enough to confidently break a lot of bones with my electrical fists.  I started playing Dex with keyboard &amp; mouse but switched to 360 controller soon after. I still found the controls to be a little bit iffy at one or two points but nothing game-breaking or overly frustrating. The option to manually save everywhere can alleviate that wee bit of frustration easily, though. The voice-acting was mostly excellent and fitting but there were a few instances where it felt more 'miss' than 'hit' to me.  Small concerns, though, since overall I found Dex pretty great, a nice - probably overlooked - gem with a well-crafted world. I can wholeheartedly recommend it, especially when you're in the need to scratch that cyberpunk itch.  Would I recommend it for full price (19,99€)? Not necessarily. Depends on how badly you need a fine, little sci fi experience. For 5€ to 15€ I'd say 'go for it'.  Also, remember to download the free bonus content before playing. It adds another ongoing sidequest to the game that seems interesting (I noticed it too late unfortunately).",1,0

This game alone is worth it just to 100% the story mode as it has a mix of funny and serious moments.  Where I spend most of my time: Online Online for me consists of doing heist missions with my friends and ofcourse the massive open mayhem in free mode. I may be going over the top for that but still. When I am sometimes on late I enjoy doing an occasional 'race or survival.' The cons of online is that it can become a bit tedious doing the same missions or heists.  I have also seen a few people with godmode, you guys knew rockstar wouldn't accept that kind of behaviour. The new DLCs for online are of really good quality but some stuff is expensive as ♥♥♥♥.

1693727,227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,"I have bought ETS2 through another site, so my playtime is not accurate. This will be a review from my own perspective. My opinion is not a subject to approval. In this review, I will use 10 different categories, each having 10 points. At the end of the review, I will sum these points up.   Gameplay  In Euro Truck Simulator 2, you control a truck driver, who slowly climbs up the career path and eventually runs a huge company, OR goes bankrupt in the process. You can customize your truck, give your driver a name, and so on. Anything you would want to customize in a truck simulator, is there. The game is very fun and playable in general. It's a great game if you want to relax after or before work/school. You can also level up in various fields!  Gameplay score -  10/10     Sound  The game features very realistic truck sounds, and I have no complaints about those. You can hear the rain, thunderstorm, etc. But the biggest flaw I noticed is that I don't hear the AI cars/trucks passing by. It might be a problem with either my sound card or settings, but if I am wrong, I will update my review when I figure out how it really is.  Sound score -  9/10     Graphics  As a game developer myself, I do understand that if the point of the game is functionality, then of course graphics must be put to second, or latter place. Therefore, the graphics and animations for ETS2 are as good as they should be for a truck simulator. I'd really give 11 points here if it only was not against my rules!  Graphics score -  10/10     Difficulty  My first hours were of course quite difficult to understand the controls. But what helped the the most are the manual and the online ETS2 guide. Thanks to those, I learned the controls and how to play this game really quickly. The developers put their thought into this and for that, I salute them. I don't remember if there was a tutorial, I think there was... I'll check when I get back home.  Difficulty score -  10/10     Variety  There is a huge variety of landscape, trucks, A.I. cars/trucks, buildings, and everything I would expect this game to have. There are lots of upgrades to choose from. The developers did a great job on that part. The only bad thing which stands out to me the most is probably the people walking on the streets of the cities. Yeah. There are none. But hey, it's a driving game, and maybe the developers decided not to include pedestrians in order to either optimize the game, or invest more time on more important things like trucks/landscape.  Variety score -  9.5/10    Originality  I haven't really played any other truck simulators in the past, so I'll just put a full 10 here.   Originality score -  10/10    Economy  The economic/business management part of this game, however could be improved much more. There's really not much you can micromanage. You can't negotiate with your employees about salary, you can't promote them(only level them up). You can't enter how much you really want to take from the bank. There are no competitors, even if you see the actual A.I. trucks driving on the road. However, the economic part of the game is still playable, I'm not saying it's not. It's just that tycoon-maniacs like me might find this as a huge flaw.  Economy score -  5/10     A.I.  The AI in this game is really well developed. It, however, still behaves strangely sometimes - the cars sometimes don't follow the road rules, sometimes they glitch out. But overall, the AI just about right.  A.I. score -  8/10     Controls  Like i stated before, the controls are well-accessible, and are easly to learn and customize. You can even use a wheel with pedals, pretty much what all driving games offer, right? Perfect controls.  Controls score -  10/10     Price vs. Quality  The game is 20 euros. It is too low. Should be 40, or 50! Buy it before it raises! You will not regret it!  Price vs. Quality score -  10/10   Overall   Overall score -  91.5/100  ",1,0

4293712,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"There are elements of Telltale's Game of Thrones that are good, but overall it's kind of a convoluted mess. The main problem is that it's got the worst narrative elements of the show--having to balance multiple POV characters in varying locales, making it incredibly difficult to feel any particular emotional connection to one character or another. This makes some of the choices you're presented with feel rather empty, and it prevents the game from even approaching the emotional intensity of The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us.  With regard to choices, a lot of folks seem to be complaining that their choices don't 'matter'; that is, they don't change the overall plot. This doesn't really bother me, because I don't expect them to. This is an adventure game afterall. What I do expect is that the choices are difficult and emotionally affecting. As noted above, the narrative structure of the game can work against the choices feeling profound, but there are a number of decisions through the series' six episodes that do really stick with you.   While the game does a pretty good job of fully fleshing its POV characters, the villains are one-dimensional and cartoonish, and the guest appearances from series regulars largely feel forced. The game has interesting implications for the GOT?/ASOIAF universe due to some of the events of the last episode, but of course there's always the question of whether the story will even be considered canon. (That said, it does seem to be canon in the universe of the TV show.) Ultimately, I am interested in seeing if the North Grove shows up at any point in either the books or the show.  It's hard to say whether I recommend this game or not. I feel like it was an interesting experiment on Telltale's part, but it's one that's largely unsuccessful. Hopefully they will learn from their missteps here and the inevitable sequel will not be such a mess. Still, I did enjoy playing it, even as I found the endless POV changes a bit gruelling. I could see fans of the show going either way on it--it expands the show's universe in a potentially important way, but it can be a bit of a slog to play. Telltale diehards will likely be disappointed, but will get a lot out of seeing what works and what doesn't. In the end, it's a pretty big disappointment after the highs of The Walking Dead seasons 1 and 2 and The Wolf Among Us. I wouldn't recommend buying it for full price, but if you catch it in a sale, it's worth your time.",-1,0

816270,20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is probably one of the best story driven RPG's of the past few years in my honest opinion, and I'll be telling you why. The game is set in a world that is similar to the world of the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series by George RR Martin, which has also been made a show on HBO titled 'Game of Thrones', with more High-Fantasy elements like, Elves, Dwarves (With beards), mages, monsters, and mutants that are called Witchers. The lore of the world is just fantastic, with all of the wars and such, and just overall every creature in the game. The gameplay is another great thing about this game, as it's very similar to the Dark Souls gameplay in the sense of controls and combat, but without the proper lock on strafing system that I am used to, but hey it's fun killing a few enemies at once and cutting people's arms and heads off during a battle. And the thing that literally shines is the graphics, because they are some of the best graphics I've seen in an RPG other than Skyrim, which with mods can look like the original Crysis at max settings, and without mods just looks magnificent in general. The story of the game is one of the most captivating stories I've seen in an RPG ever, hands down... *SPOILER ALERT, MAYBE* The concept of the story is of the current King of Temeria, King Foltest being assassinated by a man who has killed a number of Kings in the world, and has reached Foltest, killing him before Geralt of Rivia, the King's bodyguard, a Witcher, can stop him, before guards arrive and find Geralt kneeling next to the King's body, jailing him. Now, you must find a way to clear your name and face dangers that could lead to a whole other thing entirely. This is where your adventure begins.  I give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, a perfect score: 10/10!   I highly recommend you buy this game, you don't even need to play the first game, as I've honestly never played it myself, and I can still follow the story very well.",1,0

5154326,391540,Undertale,"There isn't really anything that I can say about this that the other (currently) 66,000+ positive reviews here haven't already said, so I'll point out this: it took me over a year to finally play the game because I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it, but I downloaded the demo to show to my twelve-year-old sister, who loved it, and I ended up buying it on a whim to play with her. That is genuinely one of the best decisions that I've ever made; it became her favourite game of all time, we played through it three times as a pacifist alone (all of my time clocked into this game on Steam was from playing it with her) and, as someone who's been playing games all his life, playing it through with her was one of the best experiences that I've ever had with a video game. If you have a younger sibling or child in their early/mid teens (who won't turn their nose up at pixel graphics),  please  make sure that you play this game with them. The story of the game is almost tailor-made for that and I can't possibly recommend it enough. Of course, if you  don't  have a younger sibling or child, play it anyway, because it's one of those games that can absolutely be enjoyed and loved by all ages, and appreciated for very different reasons by people of different ages. This is not a 'kiddy' game at all, never assumes that the player is an idiot and touches on some rather grown-up themes in very tasteful ways, and in a much better way than a lot of games do.  Undertale is a game with an incredible story with important, thought-provoking messages topped with surprisingly great humour, a beautifully realised world and what is honestly one of my favourite game soundtracks of all time. Even though the gameplay is a little more reserved than in most games, the gameplay that you do get is surprisingly innovative and very unique; I do not like typical RPGs or SHMUP/bullet Hell games  at all , but, here, they are combined in a way that eradicates everything that I dislike about both genres, the biggest being the relatively hands-off approach of typical turn-based combat and the relentlessness and nauseating visuals of bullet Hell games for someone like me. Even though I've been playing video games all my life, getting to experience it in person and introduce it to someone who loves it possibly even more than I do has genuinely been one of the best gaming experiences that I've ever had.",1,0

Also: Do not play this game on a 32-bit operating system, it will become unplayable after about 20 hours due to too much activity in the game world for your ram to handle.

2152050,238890,Skyward Collapse,"I'll be honest, this is not a genre I usually like, so I'm a bit biased. Still, I have played several of these world/empire-building resource management games, and there are some I've liked better than others. Unfortunately, this is not one of the better ones.   The most off-putting putting part for me was the bland graphics. I did not like the mix of isometric land tiles and flat 2D sprites. It felt like a bunch of bitmaps moving over each other, drawn by two different people. Some of the menus were a little confusing for me, though they might be more intuitive for people who play this type of game more often. The graphics and interface aren't terrible, but everything just seems so dull. The whole game could have used a bit of polish.  It does one creative thing - you control two warring factions, and the object isn't to have one beat the other, but to keep both sides balanced. It's a nice twist, but unfortunately it doesn't make the game much more interesting.   But again, this isn't my type of game, so take my review with a grain of salt. If you're into this kind of game, read a few more reviews before you make up your mind. But if you're like me, and only enjoy the best standouts of this genre, you'll probably be as underwhelmed as I was. ",-1,0

2048023,236130,Horizon,"1) meaningful research topics that are not incremental and are worked on one or a few at a time. Obtaining a research should be a game changer in some way. This is the most important negative point. Games with incremental research have it very wrong. 2) More aids are needed regarding colonies, navigating between them, viewing the summary, knowing what each is working on... many other aids. The queue and understanding of how that all works is needed. It appears the colonies can work on 5 things or 1 thing with equal speed. Only the cost that must be paid limits it. Is that intentional. It would imply that max efficiency is to work each aspect in parallel. Is that intended. I like that individual colonies are controlled, verses ordered en mass, but managing large numbers of them should be relatively easy. 3) I like the way scouts and colony ships work, such as the ability of scout ships to survey and the ability to refit used colony ships. 4) The look and feel of the game universe and sectors is also interesting. I have not played enough to fully evaluate those but I like it. Note: By saying 'Yes' for recommended it is actually more yes than no, maybe 5.5 out of 10, where the research is -2.

300789,12200,Bully: Scholarship Edition,"One of my all time favorite Rockstar games, which I personally enjoyed much more than the likes of GTA IV and V. I played Bully all the time my PS2 when it came out a decade ago and, wanting to relive that nostalgia, recently picked it up on sale for a few dollars. Unfortunately most of the reviews did not mention how absolutely broken it is for Windows 10. And when I say broken I mean crashing literally every 15 or, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes. And for an older game with no autosave function that means redoing missions, classes, and favors again, and again, and again.   I am aware there are many 'fixes' to the crashing issue, I've spent hours searching for all of them, but not one of them has worked for me. Some report that their game works fine and some of the solutions have solved their crashing problems, but beware that many of the solutions that work for some do not work for others. It's a shame that such an outstanding game was given such an abysmal pc port, but as it is now I can not recommend it.

From the great mind of Tim Schafer comes two different characters that are both trying to change something about their life. With Vella, a young girl that lives in a small village focused on sweets who is to be sacrificed to a monster named Mog Chothra, she thinks it would be best to try and fight the monster so no more lives are taken by it, and Shay, a young boy who lives on a space ship with a computer that treats him like a baby, would like to do something dangerous for once instead of being treated like a child. While the game has yet to see part 2 released and is a little short because of that, it is still a very well done adventure game that has some puzzles that are easy to understand, as well as some of the best voice acting and writing in the genre, with voice actors such as Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Richard Horvitz, Hynden Walch, Wil Wheaton, and many others.",1,0

The game follows the story of a farmer boy going after his father. I won't say anymore as to not spoil it, but even though it is kind of in your 'standard medieval genre,' I felt the story was in depth enough to make it stand apart.  Pros: -Art/style/music was great -Achievements were appropriate and interesting -Has somewhat of a hidden object feel (you'll understand once you play) -Contains RPG elements -Fantastic story  Cons: -A lot of back tracking and running around -No list of current quests (that I could find/access)  Mehs: -I'm pretty sure I popped a blood vessel trying to find the last blue shroom.

2509954,246070,Hack 'n' Slash,"TL;DR ---- This game has a great concept and art style but ultimately fails to provide a good gameplay experience.  Great concept that works for the start of the game. Later on it devolves into messy visual rooms of code that are more difficult to understand than actual code. Useless for someone without an understanding of coding concepts and for anyone else too simple to break through.  The story is rather dull and lacks direction. A huge amount of my time spent in this game is simply wandering around the world trying to figure out where to go rather than actually solving any puzzles.  The art style is very attractive but gets ruined by an item picked up later in the game which puts a messy overlay over this.  This game could really have benefitted with additional content, more purpose made interesting puzzles, a well thought out driving story rather than a balled up handful of clichés. The concept provides a basis for a useful way to introduce people to the concepts of programming which they managed well to a certain point after which it feels they lost focus, gave up and stamped it as finished.  The concept is great hopefully future games will learn from this game and improve upon it and create something fun and educational.",-1,0

4948591,381210,Dead by Daylight,"I've been playing DbD for about at week and a half now and I do not regret making this purchase in the least. The game more often than not in my experience provides tense and competitive gameply. Having really intense and close games only to make it out last just as the killer is downing you with your heart racing provided the tension, and ultimately satisfaction or disappointment, that I don't experience too incredibly often in games. Furthermore I find playing with a controller more immersive in first- and third-person games, crazy I know, and luckily I've been able to play perfectly fine with my 360 controller. Also unlike like others, and I'm not saying they aren't having problems, other than people backing out I've never really experience long matchmaking times so in that respect I have no complaints.   Now, despit all that their can be a fair amount of frustation, expecially when factoring in that you're playing against actual people, who you know behave like people. Do you get stomped on occasionally and camped? Do people try to exploit routes in the maps? Sure but fixes are being worked on for the camping and I don't recall knowingly having infinites used on me. Has my game crash? Yep, twice but both at the start of a match and given how much enjoyment I'm having they didn't phase me too much.

You can either go for Stealth, and help the world by not killing anything that moves, taking out your targets in non-lethal ways. Or you can be that guy that kills stuff, how you play will affect characters attitude towards you later as your progress and ultimately affect the ending. I personally recommend trying Stealth for your first playthrough.  The world of this game is wonderfully created and incredibly interesting to explore, with many books and snippets of dialogue that add to the lore of the world. And of course who can ignore the games art style? Grim and dark and industrial, yet in some places lavish and full of luxury, with just the right amount of supernatural and technology to make it a very unique and enjoyable experience.

4695690,360430,Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"Ok. Lets start with the elephant in the room. First of all, this game WAS framerate locked at 30FPS on launch. LAME. It took the developers about 30 hours (after an uproar from PC gamers) to patch the game. Now the framerate is unlocked. Additionally, the patch appears to have polished the game in a few other ways as well. If you were holding off because of this, now is the time to buy, as it has been resolved. I'm frankly annoyed that the issue was there to begin with, but I'm also extremely impressed at how quickly it was patched. This game is raw, and gritty. I like that! They don't attempt to hide any racial tension, swear words, gore, or anything else that might offend anyone. This is a raw gangster story, and thats what the Mafia games have always been about. It is slightly strange to be taking down the Italian Mob that we worked so hard on building in the last 2 games, but the new characters are voiced well, interesting, and well written. I'm ok with this too! This game goes out on a limb and takes risks. They are portraying content that some may not like, and making a huge change on a beloved series. As a MASSIVE Mafia 2 fan, I'm actually ok with this. I would like to see Mafia 4 return to the Italian mob, as that bunch has always been a fun one to explore, but I'm ok with this detour. This game explores the other side of the Italian Mob. What happens when they run over the wrong people. Ect. If you like open world games, this is certainly worth a purchase. Especially when I see that we have been given some wonderful options like disabling aim assitance and field of view. I do wish there were a few more graphical choices in the settings menu, but overall I am pleased with my purchase, and post-patch I've decided NOT to refund. Enjoy! -PR0XIDIAN",1,0

6202705,65930,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,"This is a poorly made pile of garbage that should've never seen release. Even knowing that there's new dlc for it makes me want nothing more than my money back, and some mind bleach so I can forget I ever played it. Allow me to go into detail as to why: First and foremost, the game isn't finished. There are graphical and technical glitches all over the place, but not so much as to make the game unplayable. The game also looks like something from 2003, but with an extreme bloom filter and some shiney guns. Remember the whole research and progressing threat thing from xcom? Yeah, that's nowhere to be found in here. You have a series of very linear missions, with some side missions, and a cast of side characters who really are completely underdeveloped. Your soldiers all have one voice. One voice, with no variations, like in xcom EU/EW. The only condition I'd see as feasible ground for buying this pile of donkey ♥♥♥♥ would be if the developers were holding you ransom, with a gun to your freaking head, and were telling you to buy it.  It took me about 14 hours to beat, so I guess it's kind of a long-ish game, but so's getting your ♥♥♥♥ probed with a spoon. A long game isn't necessarily a good thing, if the game itself is garbage. The only really good thing I can say is that there's a relatively good twist at the end. It actually comes very close to being the best part of the game for me--but it's at the end, so the best part was when I finally beat this pile of ♥♥♥♥, and uninstalled it.   In short: DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES",-1,0

1830954,230410,Warframe,"YES. YES.  If you like speedy slaughter, excellent parkour and an atmospheric futuristic environment, this game is for you.  Skip to the bottom if you want a new player tutorial.  +PROS+ + Easy to learn mechanics, with what to master later on in the game. + Several 'classes' to choose from, each with unique abilities. + No 'bad choices' in picking your weapons or warframe. + Fresh, variable environment. + Several stories to follow. + Regular and special event with rewards. + Comprehensive and steady advancement system. + NOT PAY TO WIN.  + You can achieve everything for FREE. What you pay for is time.  -CONS- - The only game with a good honest economy. - The only game with good balance and proper effort from the creators. - We need more games like this. - Archwing quests are annoying because of hitbox collision, boo hoo. - Err...  - Ugh.. - Cons, yeah...  - Oh right, too little customisation.  ---------------------------------------- Beginner's guide: Warframe is simple as it gets!  1. What is a Warframe? You are the Tenno, a space ninja, sporting a skin tight battlesuit called a Warframe.  This grants you four powers, a bit like in a moba.  These become available to you as you level up.  They are slotted on your alphanumeric 1,2,3, and 4, being your ultimate power. You maneuver by WASD like in any FPS game.  You shoot with left mouse, zoom with right mouse. Crouch with CTRL Jump with SPACE  2. What are armaments? You equip your warframe with a Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapon. Primary are big guns, bows, rifles, cannons, gunblades, heavy stuff. Secondary are pistols, shurikens, kunai, light stuff. Primary and secondary have ammo, which you pick up as you go along.  Various types of ammo are colour-coded so learn which colour reloads what type of primary or secondary weapon. Not hard. You switch between primary and secondary by pressing F. You switch to melee by holding F or you can quick melee by tapping E. Melee are anything. Swords axes staves bladeguns etc. You attain your weapons by crafting them in your Liset.  3. What's the Liset? It's your personal one-man spaceship. You see them fly in when you start a mission and pick you up when you end your mission. There are various amenities in the Liset that will be of service to you, including your forge and armory. The game will teach you these, just pay attention.  4. Loot? You can loot EVERY ITEM, including Waframes. PAY ATTENTION. YOU CAN LOOT EVERYTHING. INCLUDING WARFRAMES. Or you can buy almost everything from the cash shop. ALMOST. USE THE WIKI.  4. What are MODs? Mods are little cards you find as drops and you can insert them into your gear, pets, warframe or archwing.  You do this in your Liset, in the Armory.  You can level up these mods.  The game will teach you how.  They are a must, they make you stronger. ALL OF THEM CAN BE LOOTED. USE THE WIKI.  5. What is Platinum? It's the currency. You can sell your loot from the Void, or you can spend real money for Platinum.  The economy is perfectly free, and you can get anything if you are patient and smart about it.  6. How do I begin? I'll give you one way to start the game, I'm not saying this is the best or the only way but it has its merit. USE THE WIKI.  I recommend you pick Mag. There is little difference in which frame you pick as far as your ability to slaughter goes, but the Mag has several abilities which I find benefit your team even if you are a newbie and you have what to learn. Think of the Mag as a semi-healer aoe support loot collector.  SKILL1 - PULL :: This skill makes you able to pull enemies and with the Greedy Pull MOD, loot to you. You used to be able to pull things through walls but now you have to have a clean line of sight. Boo hoo. Still a godly skill. Get Greedy Pull MOD asap!! SKILL2 - SHIELD THING :: This skill makes you recharge your shields and deal the enemy's shield as damage to them. Works wonderfully on Corpus mobs. Aka box heads, aka robotmen aka Corpus mobs. SKILL3 - BULLET MAGNET THING :: This skill creates a bubble around a target which will draw in all the gunfire. Very useful in heavy combat.  SKILL4 - OMFG I'M MAGNETO :: You lift and damage and drop and damage and damage and damage enemies. It hurts, so use it a lot.  Other mods to get: Look up the mag youtube video for the right build. USE THE WIKI.  Once you are in, you get picked up for the story. It will teach you everything you need to know. Once you kick Vor's behind, you get to be on your way. To level up easily, complete every mission node on every planet. Team up with others for better results.   btw. USE THE WIKI.  I hope this helps.  ps: USE THE WIKI.",1,0

832213,209870,Blacklight: Retribution,"This game is full of well-designed maps, gun mod variations and play tactics.  Unfortunately, the gameplay relies less on skill and more on wallet capacity. Sure, you can grind for days on end to slowly ascend the levels, but you have to spend countless hours gaining the free currency to be able to buy 1 single item to keep. The rent system may seem a good compromise, but why can't I just keep that handy revival injector I never really want to lose?  Matches are wildly unpredictable, you either have a game full of free players/unskilled cashburners that has the potential for balance, or (most likely) you end up in a match where if you don't have cool glowy armor, boots that trail when you run, every slot of your weapon modded and elemental ammunition, you're just an animate china pot among super-powered commandos.

Otherwise, look for another free FPS that actually has validity among the gaming community, and isn't peppered full of negative reviews like mine and others",-1,0

4485797,345390,King's Quest,"What's the game really like? From one KQ fan to another, it's different. BUT, its just as enjoyable.  What's the bad news? First off, I must say it's quite easy to beat in comparison to the old games. Most players have it beaten within 6 hours, and thats mostly because items are easy to find, and the puzzles, as to how you use the items, aren't necessarily challenging. I found myself really 'stumped' only once. Also, there's no dead ends, so no need for saves. And as many have said, the Quick-time events are not cool. And unfortunatly there are a LOT of quicktime events. Dealing with repeating dialogue isn't honestly that bad though. I died a fair few times, but re-listening to the dialogue once or twice wasn't near as bad as some make it out to be. To summarize: Easy, no deadends (easy), and QTE's.  So, why do I reccomend?  It's Kings Quest. Through and through. Quirky items, puzzles that are sometimes difficult to piece together, enjoyable characters which are quite memorable, immersive worlds, humor, puns, Daventry, and a great new story. The artwork, animation, music, easter eggs, and voice acting are all bonuses. Sure, gameplay has changed, but I immensely enjoyed every minute and can't wait to play the upcoming chapters as well as play this again with different decisions.  Still on the fence? Short and sweet: It's Kings Quest for the first time in 17 years. While you fondle your $10-$40 thinking, I'll be spending my time in Daventry, thoroughly enjoying the nostalgia whilst making new King's Quest memories like I did many years ago!",1,0

Although 4 isn't much in retrospect, it didn't seem like I had fewer options, rather it seemed like the whole thing was simpler. There's also the added bonus of re-playing the same level many times and making completely different beats each time through. There are several songs you must apply beats to, and at the end of every level it combines all the songs into one *cosmic jam* for you to listen to!

2440355,244630,NEOTOKYO°,"NeoTokyo started as a source mod way back in the day. I couldn't tell you exactly when I started playing but it was near the time that steam came out along with the orange box. That said, it had always been a great game I occasionally dipped my toes into over the years.   During those years, a small, tight-knit community has formed (ANP) and it has only been recently that I have dug deeper into the game and it's culture. Like the community, Neotokyo is meant to be accepted wholly with it's flaws intact, they only serve to make the game a richer, character building experience.   Indeed NT would not be the game I and many others have come to love if it didn't crash every few map changes (redlight!). I have come to embrace these NT-isms as part of the entire experience, as have many others.   The game has not changed much since 2006 but it does not need to. If you are looking to play this free source mod, just know a few things:  -Know when to play, certain times of the day will bring more players to servers if it is afternoon/evening/night in their respective timezone. This has been my tactic to work around the small amount of active players.  -Friendly Fire is always on, so be mindful of teammates when lobbing dat nade into that crowded hallway. While it is mostly forgiven, consistant teamkilling will bring the ire of the admins upon you.   -Use a mic, beyond the tactical implications, getting to f--- around with the rest of the NT community is always a laugh.   -Have fun, this is not CoD, Battlefield or even CS:GO, it is a free mod that people really enjoy for the fun of the game with competition being second to that.   Keep those in mind and join up today!  I hope to see you online with us soon, NT FRIDAYSSS!!!!!! (be aware, it gets weird on Fridays)",1,1

3415585,281640,The Banner Saga 2,"Since I really loved The Banner Saga 1, I made sure to pre-order the second as soon as it became available, and started playing it on the same evening it was released. Well, it took me around 12 hours over three long evenings to beat the game, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to begin again very soon. At the time of writing this review, Steam says I've been playing for 8 hours, but it didn't take into account around 4 hours of game time in which I was offline.  For those of you not familiar with the games all, The Banner Saga is a series of Tactical Role Playing Games. While the game's environment is a fictional fantasy world, it is somewhat connected to the norse mythology. I don't know much about the norse mythology, but I did notice some connections, such as Hogun and Mogun, and I suppose there are others as well.  Anyway, just like in the first game, in The Banner Saga 2 you alternate between leading 2 different groups of adventurers (for a lack of a better term) on their continued quest. The game is a direct continuation of the first, so while you can watch a recap of what happened during the first game and start playing the second one immediately, I really suggest playing and beating the first one first, so you can carry your savegame over to the second, and continue with the exact same party you ended the first game with.   The battle-system is interesting, refreshing but simple enough to learn. I know some people have been complaining it's too simplistic, but I don't share that view. The graphics are great and so is the soundtrack, but what makes this game so much fun for me, is the story. It's refreshingly dark and interesting. Also, the choices you make have a major impact on the game, which also means you'd probably want to play through it more than once, to explore different options and see what happens when you choose different directions.  Also, it seems like the developers managed to take some of the problematic aspects of the first game and improve them. For one, The Banner Saga 2 is much more flexible than the first, when it comes to promoting your characters. You get much more freedom in choosing which ones to level-up, which in turn, gives you more tactical options in battles. Not only that, you also get a much larger veriaty of characters to choose from. In addition, this time there are training scenarios, in which you get to learn to use your characters' most important special abilities.   I really like this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes tactical and story-driven RPGs.",1,0

6008571,55230,Saints Row: The Third,"'But I am a method actor!' exclaims Josh and then he leaves. Leaves everybody. In a bank. Where his pals are about to complete a bank robbery. It is hilarious! Hilarious how stupid some of these characters are and the one-liners in Saints Row The 3rd almost equal to the ones in our favourite American films from the '80s or '90s.  Volition made a replica of GTA IV but made a much better version of it. This is a properly optimised game that looks good and runs well on our PCs. And if you thought the script of GTA included a lot of conversations with dozens of jokes you'll immediately forget that game once you get to know the members of the Saints.  The story revolves around the Saints, an always purple-clad gang who has just taken over Steelport (the fake city where the story takes place) but is thriving to achieve more. To further extend their control over the city they must annihilate the mysterious Syndicate who commands the 3 gangs of Steelport. But then again the government does not like the too much bang-bang in the city so a special anti-gang unit is introduced and you will also have to face its leader, a ruthless general.  Gameplay is exactly the same as what you get used to in GTA IV. There are missions initiated by beacons once approached but the main story missions are launched by calling your buddies on your cellphone. Otherwise, you go wherever you want and do whatever you want in the city. Really. I like how the game rewards me if I hit civilians or when driving for a long time on the oncoming lane or when drifting for a long time.   Remember when Niko hits a car at high speed and flies out of the windshield in GTA IV? Were you laughing hard when that happened just as I did? Well, in Saints Row you have a side mission called 'insurance fraud' which means you need to let yourself hit by a car and the more hits you receive the easier it is to fly high (?) and instead of hitting the ground you need to try to hit the hood of another car and so on and so on...the multiplication and the amount of score you receive is enormous! So, you have to be prepared for doing a lot of stupid things with the Saints. This is a must and if you are not up for that you had better quit while you can!  You have collectibles, of course, for the sake of achievements and longevity: you collect cash, sex dolls and drugs. And you can steal vehicles and assassinate people. And you can level-up and spend your hard-earned cash on upgrades. And if you have DLCs you have weapons such as the shark gun that pours blood on people who are then attacked by a shark (yes, the appear from below the asphalt). Stupid fun! You can also have a lot of properties in the city just so you can actually feel like being someone controlling a huge area!  The game is very funny. The cars are fast and fully upgradeable. You can apply upgrades you have never thought of, by the way. Turning on the radio while driving is just as fun as in GTA. You have a dozen tracks available so everyone can find his or her taste. Voice acting is equally good and did I mention Burt Reynolds is the mayor of the city? And that there is a side mission where you drive while a tiger is sitting next to you in the car bothering you?  The story is mediocre at best but really funny. Saints Row is a must and it is one of my all time favourite games!",1,1

I would say wait till 2017. I'll check back every month but I wouldn't waste anymore time on it until this has been fleshed out more. Game is still very grindy with ships being too expensive except for hardcore players. In addition the good A rank equipment often costs more than the ship itself. I've seen this before with MMOs. Using grind barriers to slow progression through content to extend the life of the game. Getting the ship you want should be the early to mid goal. Not the endgame.  Note: With version 2 the new mission system is much improved. Just not all the mission types.  Engineers Update: No go on this one. There is a rep grind wall to get to any meaningful upgrades. Upgrades are not a fixed set of value changes. Instead they chose to go with a 'Luck of the Draw' system which only adds to the frustration.",-1,0

The changes both extend and limit the player's abilities in ways that are extensively -- but not exaustively -- explored by the game.  Like many good puzzle games, this one is best played until frustrated, then left alone for a while, and returned to. I did make it through without hints or walkthroughs, though after getting stuck on a relatively early level I considered writing a planner. In the end, setting the game down and picking it up again over the course of a week got me moving again.  Generally, the levels that I found most troublesome were ones where a new mechanic was possible to use but not required to finish the level; I'd find myself focusing on using the newly available mechanic rather than solving without it.  As in 'English Country Tune' there are a few somewhat exhausting levels (that is, levels where the solution is clear but the execution takes a fair bit of time). But, in 'Stephen's Sausage Roll' I found that generally the execution was less daunting than I feared.",1,0

2430584,24420,Aquaria,"  Short Verdict  : Wow. Aquaria is a stunningly beautiful metroidvania indie game published back in 2007, but it's still a pearl! I literally dove into it from the moment I started and I really had a blast. I'm very thankful to Jaws for not only trading it with me, but also for recommending it. If you like metroidvanias, indie games and pretty 2D graphics, don't miss this one for nothing! Oh, make sure you play it with a controller, since it's a lot better (except menus, which are easier to navigate with a mouse).    Pros  : Oh, where to start....    Very interesting mechanic, where you can transform into different forms, each with its specialty and abilities that unlock more and more of the world    A HUGE world for you to explore and swim around    Has a great, deep story that pushes you to keep going    Lots of treasures, costumes, energy boosts, pets, songs, ingredients and food recipes for you to collect    I think it's safe to say that its difficulty level is absolutely perfect--not insanely hard, but don't be fooled by the cute graphics, this game is not a walk in the park either    Very interesting boss fights--while they depend on your skills, they're first and foremost puzzles    Being able to fill the map with customizable markers is not only a great feature, but also necessary if you want to master the game without looking (too much on) FAQs    Absolutely gorgeous 2D graphics    Awesome BGM with many different great tracks    Great voice acting, even if you compare it to mainstream games    If you're into it, there are even some interesting mods, mainly Sacrifice (a story-driven prequel) and Labyrinth (a small sequel focused on, you guessed, a labyrinth map)     Cons  :    Aquaria's world is so huge it might take a lot of time when you have to backtrack to explore old areas after acquiring new forms/abilities. There are travel turtles that carry you around (also seahorses you can ride for faster shorter movements), but I think there could've been at least twice as much turtles for a world that size. Also, being able to choose your destiny instead of having to cycle through them would be great. I didn't have to use them a lot, but it was kind of boring when I had.    Controls for when you're out of the water are a bit too clumsy for me. Of course they should be a bit clumsy, since you're supposed to live in the water, but they could've been better.

5519008,432010,World's Dawn,"A wonderful game for fans of the Harvest Moon series. World's Dawn is a beautiful game with a very interesting and (so far) likeable cast of characters. As in the HM fashion your character starts out with a farm that hasn't had an owner for a while in a small village, and it's up to you to liven things up again. There are festivals and different random events that happen and while the main plot of the game has yet to reveal all of itself to me, it's safe to say I'm excited to see what will happen.   The mechanics are so far a lot simpler that what you may go in expecting. Take farming for example, instead of a huge field that you have to clear out and will possibly never fill with crops and flowers, you have a small twenty plot field for your crops. There is also a simple mining and refining system, fishing took a few tries to get used to but it is also rather fun as well. The most annoying mechanic of the game would probably be how running reduces your precious endurance meter by a lot. Now, that wouldn't be such an issue if walking didn't feel so slow and the map felt so big. Perhaps walking will not but such a chore later in the game once I learn the map and increase said endurance meter.   Other than that tiny little critism so far, this game is very enjoyable. I would say the price it very fair for the amount of content and potential playtime you are getting. There are different things that make it stand apart from the Harvest Moon series itself, but it definitely feels like a love letter to the good old days of the farming simualtor series.",1,1

1902006,232790,Broken Age,"I have no regrets backing this game. It's a charming adventure game with an interesting story, engaging characters, and clever dialogue. Everything I wanted out of a Tim Schaefer game. It took longer than promised, but if you watch their documentary, you'd learn why.  Honestly, my one complaint are the puzzles in the second half of the game. People complained that the first half's puzzles are easy. And to be fair, they are for the most part. The second half, however, has some incredibly frustrating, unintuitive puzzles that make you want to pull your hair out. Without giving anything away, these are the pipe, knot, and wire puzzles. Most especially the wire puzzle, which comprises most of the final puzzles in the game. These especially require pen and paper beside you to write down diagrams and guides. It's the only way to complete them without having to go back and forth too much.  Still, despite those frustrations, I greatly enjoyed the game. It's a satisfying game that any adventure game fan will enjoy. It's no Grim Fandango or Monkey Island, but it's still a perfectly good adventure game. I honestly don't think it's worth the full asking price, but it's certainly worth it if you can nab it on a 50% (or lower) sale.",1,0

1892336,232430,Gone Home,"Gone Home isn't your typical game insofar as many consider what a game is. It doesn't have shooter or RPG mechanics. Doesn't rely on skill or reflexes. It is instead, more of an interactive story. One that you need to put together through notes, phone records, and journal entries. You piece together these lives by going through their most intimate posessions. It's a coming of age story and a love story and an experience that hit close to home. I personally loved this experience, while i understand that it most certainly may not be for everyone. It is short, coming in at around 2 hours of playtime but it genuinely rewards those who take their time.  If you are a fan of story driven games, such as the walking dead, I highly recommend giving this one a try. Steam regularly has it on sale for $6.99.",1,0

2198479,239140,Dying Light,"This game is too good. The developers really thought of everything.  Items are easy to find, crafting is a simple system which only requires finding the plethora of materials around the city, and zombies actually take some time and thought to kill (good luck if you get stuck in a group of them). The quests are fun but you can spend hours just running around and never do them, finding plenty of other stuff to open, save, or scavenge.   Co-op is very smooth with drop in/drop out features. When you're in a game hosted by your friend and he/she leaves the game never ends, continuing your missions exactly where you're at. You can join a game in which players are farther behind you and your inventory stays updated regardless of the game you're in. IMO one of the best game mechanics is the instant, fast travel that is optional whenever someone activates a quest or elevator, making it easy to move on without having to run all the way to your coop buddy.

I gave one of the vanilla gamemodes a try but It got short lived due to the lack of online players playing on them.

2101546,237990,The Banner Saga,"It is hard to write a short review for this game, and for the first time in my life it is not because I'm drunk.  The Banner Saga by its genre is a Turn Based Strategy like XCOM (and my other games alike) where you take control of a small squad on a battlefield that is broken down in squares. Your units have perks, special skills, progression system and an inability to perform diagonal attacks (melee units). It is set in the Nordic type world where they drink lots of mead and enjoy cold weather (with Humans, Varls and Dredge being the parties involved in a conflict). And when you are not fighting you are leading a caravan from point A to point B (not you don't get to choose the road unless there is a scripted choice) and make decision on provisions, camps etc.  The gameplay is good, but not as challenging once you figure out your squad tactics. Graphics are OK, but not the best. The story is as cliché as it gets 'a great darkness is coming to destroy the world... bla bla bla'. By this point you would think that the game is average if not worse, but wait, the main value of this game is in its story delivery model and ruthless, absolute, unforgiving ruthless. The story changes based on your decision. I had three of my best soldiers killed in freak accident which are so unbelievably real that you want to cry and laugh at the same time. The game manages to create an atmosphere of fright when you actually think on your decisions as they have a heavy impact on the game. To top it off there is no quick-save or quick-load, permadeath so to say (unless you want to load a checkpoint or play around with save files). It is this part of the game that makes it awesome, as suddenly the battles and decisions are no longer a walk in a park, but rather a fight for survival. Grumpy Russian Score - 8/10  P.S.

4858796,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Dark Souls III. Prepare to Die...again and again... and again, and so on.  This has improved over Dark Souls II, returning to the aspects of Dark Souls I with a mix of the other previous games all together, with well needed changes. For example; you want to coop with a friend? WELL NOW YOU CAN! There is now a summon password feature which allows little to no hassle in finding your buddy for some jolly cooperation.  Ontop of that, the combat feels faster paced than the previous titles, not as intense as Bloodborne, but pretty darn close. There is defintely some impact felt when you smack someone or something with the weapons, really well done.  Graphics wise; the game looks beautiful, although the framerate does dip a bit in some areas and when autosaving.  In short; Yes.",1,0
3106061,265300,Lords Of The Fallen,"While the game suffered from early technical issues, I find that this game is the perfect successor to games like Blade of Darkness, Die by the Sword, and even the Duel, Deadly combat, or Ultimate combat mods for Skyrim. The fight and block mechanics are far smoother with LoTF than with Dark Souls 1 or 2.   Another thing to appreciate about LoTF is that enemies and bosses have multiple strengths and weaknesses, so there are several approaches to killing them, either by boosting stamina, using combat spells against them, ranged attacks, or different weapon types that can be easily cycles.  This game is far more polished that Dark Souls 1 or 2 from a UI, keyboard + mouse, and graphical standpoint.  If you like fighting games where situational awareness and finding your own approach to each fight is addicting, then you should really enjoy this game.",1,0
3187651,268500,XCOM 2,"Basically the best XCOM since the last one. Fixed almost every minor gameplay quirk from last game. Overwatch stacked in queue, so 1-hitpoint crippled muton berserk kamikaze no longer discharge every gun in the house. No long searches for the last hidden alien. Timers seems almost infinite comparing to the last game. Cool characters classes which actually makes difference, both career paths are needed in more or less pure form and form gameplay like it should. Spreading fires and falling debries. No way to just sit in corner and shoot strugglers. Intersting missions. Game choices which actually cost you with no way to get everything. Looting stuff and fishing money in alien network right during the shadowr... err... mission. Extensive cosmetic character editor (Hey, Japan, where are all cool sailorsenshi wigs you so proud of - game totally need some!) FALLING DAMAGE AFTER EXPLOSION, DAMN YEAH!

As you level there's factions, dungeons, daily quests, plenty to keep you busy. Not too shabby.  Cons: between mid &amp; max level devil form is still useless and the game becomes inventory tycoon, unless you expand your inventory through the usual means. Now, if the devil form was more interesting I probably would throw some money at it because the game is kind of enjoyable. But as it stands now the game's iconic devilian / devil form or whatever is a complete bore. I feel like I'm better off not using it and I've not really seen other people use it in dungeons either. With it's iconic devil form being a letdown I feel like this game fails to stand out from the competition.   I kind of hope it's better at max level but I'm not sticking around for that.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any trophy management, it only keeps your highest point kill for each animal, as opposed to letting you choose which trophies to keep, which would be nice for keeping kills of crazy long distance shots or something (but that doesn't matter since it doesn't track that info like I already mentioned.)",1,0

The only problem that I had was there is support for sony controllers on this game but very rudamentary, to the point of it being useless. You cannot specify any of the controls at all and it is locked to what i believe is southpaw which i cannot even use, at least allow more pre set control schemes to choose from.   EDIT: This game is broken and they refuse to fix it, on menus and only menus you get random artifacts and apparently i'm the only one with this problem. Once it starts then i cannot hit esc or tab to look at the score board without it scrambling artifacts everywhere, it even does it in the lobby.

5490531,428870,Take the Dream IX,"  Honestly, I was really excited to see another game from the creator/producer of 'Close your eyes'.  In the beginning of the game the idea of mixing different story lines was amazing and the dark and creepy atmosfere was perfect. However, the main story and the developing of the characters was horribly awful and sloppy. I wasn't given the chance to really see the relationship between Gwen and all the other four characters presented to us (Kayto, Vera, Luna and I don't even remember the last one). So all the dialogue between them end up being pointless melodrama that only got in the way to the game.  Nothing was really explained at the end. Also, what was the point of starting the game with the story of a Goddess and a Demon King and a bunch of magic stones if this will be barely used in the game? Really, it was really annoying.  ----SPOILER ALERT---- Also, finishing with 'it was only a dream' made me feel like that were some 2 wasted hours that I could have used to something more fun and productive.   ---END OF SPOILER ALERT---  The game would be ok, if it wasn't for this horribly lazy storytelling",-1,0

But it can be a blast and it can be nice with a friend too although most of the time they see a bunny and pick it up :) But as for story wise views it has a ok story it dosen't feel solid and feels loose as you don't always go to the next mission straight away and sometimes it falls off the main plot to go do something else and may confuse you but the worst thing is the timer. Although it may be realistic it is pretty annoying for people who are looking for the full free roam aspect as it dosen't let you do everything you want in the certain time and may ♥♥♥♥ some people off but it can still be a blast in fortune city.  79/100,1,0

777939,208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"I managed to finally get into this game after waiting a substantial length of time for a patch to fix PC issues as well as get a decent rig to start playing the higher up pc games in my library. While I haven't logged any hours on my profile, I played through on my relative's with 120% completion rate and unlocked all the endings. Batman Arkham Knight is a great game, when you peel back some of the annoying layers covering it; from the horrid PC release to the seemingly rushed release, this game is still comparable to the first two games (I don't believe Arkham Origins really counts) and is a great conclusion to the Arkham series. First, the good. The story; definitely, especially after having seen the animated series throughout and seeing how it came through to this end. The ending may confuse some people, but I think it was well done and quite satisfying. Moreover; the emotional beats this game hit compared to the others is worthy of praise. I was feeling very tense and emotional at key points during the story; the music definitely adds to this and is appreciated.  The cast of characters; with the Season of Infamy DLC, many villain arcs have come to a close and the quests were fun to play. The quest for Mr Freeze was especially heartwarming and one of my favourite sidequests. The other sidequests were... not so well done, but I'll get to that later. The combat and predator encounters are improved upon further. Throw counters and more special moves added to Batman's arsenal and actually become very useful; especially fear takedowns, which you'll need to use against the improved mooks. They actually go to every length possible to beat you with new tactics including vantage point mining, sentry guns, scanning drones, better awareness of grates, and buddying up with each other. This makes the predator encounters more dynamic and challenging without being too frustrating, given the wider options Batman has as well. Voice acting; as great as ever. And Mark Hamill's addition was great and appreciated. The visuals were definitely the best yet, but unfortunately require a decent computer to handle. Still, seeing Gotham in all its glory was breathtaking as you'll fly to the tops of huge towers and drive through vast plazas and streets; fully realising a big city like Gotham as the environment. Now for the bad parts. Unfortunately, the tracking of sidequests was handled poorly, as most are more often than not fetch quests for extra objectives that span throughout the entire game. These become an annoyance because you can't always complete a quest the first time you receive it; most just end up piling up and getting annoying as I want to finish them off early, but you almost never can. Finding these objectives can be equally frustrating as only solving Riddler challenges lets you get map trackers on them.  Speaking of; Riddler challenges were not enjoyable here. Despite having less challenges than Arkham City; each one was overall more annoying than challenging as often switches you step on give you no feedback on what has changed; leaving you running around more than you should to find what you're supposed to be doing. The riddles were worse. In the open city, it only gives you the general area of a revealed riddle. Now this is a problem as there are so many things of interest to look at (which would otherwise be a good thing) to be annoying distractions as you often have little idea of what you're looking for. It could be a small poster in a whole city block; or a distant object that might have nothing to do with the riddle you're solving. This could have been alleviated by giving the exact location of the riddle in the open city like it was in Arkham City. The Batmobile was kind of a mixed bag. At first, and especially throughout with car chases, using the Batmobile was refreshing and was always fun when chasing down mooks and APCs with tracking shots. However the tank battles got quite repetitive towards the end; not challenging enough or dynamic enough to keep my full attention for the whole thing. The more insulting thing about the Batmobile is that the majority of any boss battles are for the Batmobile. Disappointing, to say the least. Still, I enjoyed Arkham Knight very much and it's clear now how much work was put into this game. Rocksteady still did a great job and I'm surprised by how hard many reviewers are being. Probably to do with the shoddy release, but this is a great conclusion and worth getting once you can get past the release problems and somewhat frustrating riddler crap (I had to resort to looking things up online). Thank you, Rocksteady. ",1,0

3201363,268750,Magicite,"A great, roguelike game, for the strategically minded. It brings along classic 2d platformer indie elements like permadeath, MLG lewts, and challenging hp system(no regeneration for you, drink a potion m9), crafting, etc. To be honest, unlike other games, its hard to explain- besides calling it a crafting, survival, roguelike, permadeath and unlock-stuff-by-doing-different-tasks sort of game. However, with it, it lacks one thing.....  No save system. This is where the rage comes in  Magicite is a particulary fun game, with its classic rpg-roguelike-crafting feel, but you can only play one session untill you restart, which pisses me off because then I can't restart on my epic loot adventures when something on my schedule seems to pop up, or when my friend has to go we have to restart from the beginning. Sure, its a permadeath game, but that doesn't mean sometimes I want to hop back on in order to get my character with loot I spent hours getting. Also, I don't feel like they're not going to update the game anymore, so, no chance at getting a save system.   Overall, Magicite is a fun, roguelike fantasy rpg game with crafting that puts you into an underground enviornment where you have to survive, kill monsters, and get to the end. There's permadeath, and in order to unlock new things you must do different tasks and then die. On the dark side, no save system ties it to 2-3 hour long play sessions, where if you don't finish the game when you quit it can feel kind of abandoning, not allowing you to get back the loot you spent hours trying to get.  8.5/10",1,0

Play with your friends or alone; its your choice. Three main weapon types carry fighting and PvP all the way. Whether your a mage, melee, or ranged typed fighter, this game gives you a fun time with more types of blocks and items than other block games. Although there is no creative (which I think they should add) the wings and beast armors can make it feel like it is. Although progressing through tiers of armors and items can be a challenge, but it is very rewarding and fun to get there as fast as you can. I personally love defeating those bosses who think they are tough. Except I hate Planterra. Like I H-A-T-E him. Anyways, this game is overall great. So what are you reading this for? Buy it!

5189992,394230,Battleborn,"I originally recommended Battleborn, but cannot any longer do so. It's been a little bit after launch, and Gearbox still has plenty of time to fix the gripes I have with this game, but matchmaking seems purely random, matching newbies with veterans more often than not; the game is poorly optimized for graphics (my friend is unable to play 2 out of the 3 PVP gamemodes with a GPU considered within the game's specs), and there are exploits which have been around since beta.  Although I consider Battleborn a very enjoyable game when both teams are equally matched and when the game runs, Gearbox needs badly to fix its matchmaking &amp; optimization, as these two conditions are infrequent at best.  For reference, here is my original review:  Battleborn is what you could call a MOBA with FPS elements (or the other way around), typically called a 'hero shooter.' With 25 playable characters at release, 3 PVP modes with 2 maps each, and a singleplayer/co-op campaign, Battleborn has a lot of gameplay to offer--which is necessary, considering its Triple-A pricetag.  Matches usually run anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the gamemode. There's also a surrender option, and close matches may stall to timeout.  You'll hear bad things about any MOBA community, and yes, there are flamers, trolls, and ragequitters in Battleborn too. I've had a net positive experience in my first 20 hours with the official release (and more in the beta), and if you foresee having issues with other players, you can mute them quickly and easily with Tab-E (Mute All).  Character progression outside of individual matches boils down to grinding for Gear, Battleborn's equivalent of items or equipment for your character. You'll earn currency to purchase packs of (randomly-assorted) Gear by playing matches, purchase new Gear in the main menu, and thus be able to use your shiny new Gear in battle.  There's also a boatload of achievements, titles, lore, and skin to unlock. Completionists rejoice!  For those who enjoy competitive or casual multiplayer, I would absolutely recommend Battleborn. Bring some friends along or make some friends for optimum enjoyment, and remember the mute function.  As a disclaimer to my recommendation of this game, be informed that Battleborn apparently runs like ♥♥♥ on any computer with an AMD card. Here's hoping this issue gets fixed.",-1,0

5122274,391540,Undertale,"I'm not going to talk about why Undertale is a good game. You have so many other people doing that already. I want to talk about why Undertale is a good example of why video games are an art form and what it does that other medias can't.  (Contains light spoilers about the general theme of the game.)  Undertale, like most video games, puts you in the role of a character. But not the role of the protaganist. You are the Player. The game is aware there is an entity outside of itself (you) who somehow has power over everything. Taking full advantage of that, the game will praise you when you do good, and mercilessly attempt to backhand you emotionally when you do wrong. This creates an interesting feeling between the player and the game, tieing the two together in an interesting, compelling way.  If you haven't seen yet, there are also alot of 'them feels' reactions from people to the various scenes in the game. And to be honest, it's a little strange. Without giving too much away, the combat is mostly ripped from Earthbound and the characters are actually more one-dimensional than people let on. So WHY does it capture people? I think I have the answer.  It gives you the CHOICE to interact as you please with them.  The fact that people have the option to kill or befriend, or just run away, means that there is emotional investment in the decision the player makes, as opposed to a AAA game like Beyond or The Last of Us and even Bioshock: Infinite that has you stuck with a comapnion the design team expects you to care about because they're just 'there' and maybe vunerable. It's that kind of interactions that makes Undertale's endings and scenes as powerful to people as they are.  To conclude on this little essay, I personally recommend the game to anyone that wishes to give it a shot, despite the mass support and hype maybe overshooting their expectations. It's one of the best investments of £7/$10 I had with a video game.  I can Imagine undertale in an exhibit of a video game museum once people take video games seriously as an art form. I hope you do too.",1,0

But the minute i started this game i was in love, because the gameplay is just so different than other FPS games, it's not just like shooting everything untill it's dead and that's the end of the game. There is just so much more than that. This game has such a good story line and one of the funniest plot-twist, in my opinion.  Pros: - Awesome gameplay. - Awesome storyline.  - Good controls, not too crappy. - Funny plot-twist.   Cons: - Sometimes the game is a bit annoying when you run out of ammo while you have to kill someone, so you die over and over again. - Big daddys could be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill.",1,0

5875141,501180,Acan's Call: Act 1,"So after trying this game out, i wanted to provide some feedback to others/developers.   Good bits-    Graphics look very good and the modelling/animation of enemies and the level are very impressive.    Enemies are actually scary to fight and that *Small Spoiler*  big horned dude   scared the shhh out of me   The teleport mechanic has a small charge which stops spamming which i think is a good idea.   The upgrades look awesome and feel rewarding.   *TINY SPOILER*:   When i got outside, i was excited to see what i'd be able to explore and what kind of enemies i would face.   Unfortunately the demo ended there :( But it did leave me wanting to see more :D   Looks like a promising adventure game and i'm looking forward to seeing the future development of it.    Bad Bits    I was having quite a few performance issues at the start and spotty throughout the game. My graphics card was at 30% and it was still laggy with smeared colour when i moved my head. CPU was at 60% (6 Core @ 3.5) and I have a GTX 1070 so i'm pretty sure it's not that.   Unfortunately, the collision detection is pretty horrible. Sometimes you'll hit enemies and items fine, other times you'll be waggling away and getting hit through your shield.   Enemies seem to stand a bit too far away from you which means you have to teleport closer to attack and it just doesn't feel   No help or menu to view controls/settings and because of the spotty collision detection, i was left waggling at the sword/shield to try and pick it up. When i did pick it up, the sword was on my left hand (which didn't feel natural) and i was unable to pick up the shield at all. When i restarted and finally managed to, it was on my right hand which oriented it sideways and basically stopped it from blocking anything without breaking my wrist. In addition to that, no vibration or sword swinging sounds make it a bit detatched from the whole experience. As petty as it sounds, the ability to put your sword away and pull it out is a feature that although small, adds a hell of a lot to the experience. Even the ability to hit your sword against your shield to taunt enemies feels emmersive (Vanishing realms for example)   The damage system shows a 'blink'-esque effect which doesn't discernibly show pain or the location based on where you are facing.   When you finally get to the end, it asks you to press Esc to close the game, and F5 to restart...Errr...It ain't exactly easy to press that with a HMD on and controllers firmly attached at the wrists. (And yes i know you can close it through the steam VR menu, but what if i wanted to just restart the game to try it again? Just a small pain you see)    All in all, try this game. It's free and fun and gives you a sneak peek into what i think is going to be an awesome adventure game. Keep it up devs and i'll be waiting patiently for the next chapter, where i will definitely play and review it again :D.    TL;DR  I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT, GOOD JOB",1,0

Lisa has scripted horrible 'decisions' throughout and an awful one way through it type of end.  If your an emotional person I wouldn't recommend this game.

4056437,313630,The Solus Project,"For starters, I haven't had the chance to try this game on VR, so my review is with non-VR play in mind.  I really enjoyed this game, through-and-through. First of all, the art of the planetscape, with all its unique flora especially, was spectacular. While at first I doubted that the survival and story elements would cooperate, I was quickly surprised by how well they worked together to form and immersive experience. The game is really engaging; I really felt like it was  me  stranded on this strange planet, seeing so many strange things, trying to understand what was going on. There wasn't a dull moment in this game, from start to finish, but it didn't feel stressful either, like some survival games. All in all, a great experience that I intend to play again. Would also love to try this game out on VR - after playing it normally I think it would  significantly  enhance an experience I already really enjoyed.   Really the only thing I can think of about this game that bothered me was that your PDA is called 'Wilson' but has a female voice. That's literally the only thing that bothered me.

3708531,296070,MIND Path to Thalamus E.Edition,I am quite a big fan of the emerging genre of story-driven adventure games: or walking simulators as the skeptics like to say. However they could hardly call that the case in Mind Path to Thalamus. This game actually blends heavy narrative elements with a bunch of puzzles. Its a unique combination thats has never really been split as evenly as they are in this title. Caught in a dream like state you must solve various challenges to reawaken your cognitive functions while battling your emotions regarding your tragic past.  In my mind the story is the highlight of this experience. There isn't too much I can say as I don't want to spoil anything. The game starts with a hurricane crashing down on your home and you go charging in looking for your daughter Sophia. Immediately after you find you yourself in a strange land hoping from one landscape to the next. The protagonist is clearly going through a lot of turmoil and has a very dark outlook. The narrative starts out quite vague and hard to follow but as you progress it becomes more and more clear what is troubling your character.  In order to recuperate you'll have to put your mind back together through a series of puzzles. The core mechanic revolves around these little tumbleweed balls. You must move the balls to different parts of the level to activate various features such as rain to lift bridges and darkness to open various gateways. Its a really simple idea that is milked for all its worth throughout this adventure. The difficulty doesn't seem quite as balanced as it could have been with many puzzles being quite easy while some are a bit frustrating.  From a narrative perspective the puzzles actually seem purposeful. I'm used to story-driven adventure games typically being more relaxing so it was quite a different experience trying to solve puzzles at the same time. For the easier puzzles it wasn't so bad but two or three of the harder ones kind of pulled me out of my immersion in the story. I think the main problem is that this isn't a particularly long game. That is no surprise for a well polished indie game however in other puzzle centered games there is usually more time to train your brain on how to gradually get better at the puzzles.  Mind Path to Thalamus was an interesting experience. Visually it isn't as stunning as some of its predecessors but some of the panoramic scenes are quite striking. I really grew to like the story and I found the protagonist's struggles quiet interesting. The puzzles are definitely a unique addiction to the genre and most of them are quite enjoyable. The tougher puzzles may disengage you from the experience but once you see them through you'll be right back sucked in. This definitely wasn't the smoothest ride I've been on but I'm glad I saw it through to the end.,1,0

860703,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I thought this game was absolutely awful and gimmicky when I first picked it up, just hearing about it and having a couple of friends telling me about it. I played the game for a couple of hours and eventually made progress through the game after I got the hang of the controls and the mechanics.  After killing the third boss in the game I realized that I loved this game. It's a modern masterpiece for me and honestly I can still replay it while enjoying it thourougly. The sudden realization of what you can create your character to be, and the excitment of finding a new area or weapon was the most thrilling part about the game for me. I couldn't put it down until I beat it, and even then I had trouble putting it down - AGAIN!  The story of the game is wonderful yet cryptic. The developers of the game sort of had you think of the story by yourself, but wasn't entirely vague and cryptic. The game gives you a background of the world you're in, and some characters later on in the game tell you other elements of the story you can, as a player, fill in the gaps for.  The world is truely immersive in this game; even though it manages to feel sad, barren, or convoluted I still find myself having a lot of fun looking for anything I've misses. This game really brings the hunter out of me because I never miss a nook or cranny in it, and the game does a good job encouraging that as well.  Now for the PVP: Asides from one of the worst communities on the internet to exist, I manage to mutually co-exist with them and still manage to have fun fighting other players and helping them. Sure you get hate-messages from people you murder, but for me and some others I celebrate and screencap the hate-mail and do mini celebrations.   The networking is a bit dodgy and has some exploits and hardcoded bugs (Look up Dead Angling if you don't know what it is) but honestly none of them break the game.  It is my 10/10 game even if it's a horrid port to PC easily fixed by configuring a controller and some networking mods.   Praise the Sun!",1,0

It's fast paced and easy to pick up. You do get tons of loot easily, but there is also tons of rare loot that almost no one has.   There are boxes that drop after level 10(Chaos Box) that have a rare chance to give you cash shop items. So it's possible to get pretty much any cash shop item just by playing the game.  I've seen no Pay to Win features all, this game probably has one of the best microtransaction systems I've seen, also many of the cash shop items are purchasable using a currency earned in game(Cubits).  Once you get around lvl 15+(Uber 3 and up) the game starts to get pretty difficult. I didn't expect this with how easy the earlier worlds are, but it actually has some decent challenge. It has some good 8 man group content in Shadow Arenas, and soon they are adding Shadow Towers which I don't know the details of but I'm guessing its similar on a larger scale.

2597493,249230,Risen 3 - Titan Lords,"When I look around the internet, all I see about Risen 3 are bad reviews. Now that I finally got to try it myself, I can say that most of the people's complaints about this title are overstretched by what may be a long lasting hate for the Risen series started from Risen 2, just because it 'wasn't like Gothic'. This game is a product of high level, featuring an interesting storyline with moral choices that affect your gameplay (even though some decisions that should alter your soul just don't), can be played in many different ways (swordsman, mage, ranged to make some examples) and lets you choose between three factions that provide you with spells that give you more options in a fight (even if the more skilled may stick with meelee, because of the riposte). The animations for sprinting and jumping look strangely similar to the ones of Assassin's Creed Black Flag (I could be wrong), but I don't care because they look and feel more realistic than the ones of the previous chapters. My sole complaint is about the Demon Hunters: I know, I know it's lore... but does he really have to shave his head?!",1,0

5022505,385760,,"I've been playing NBA2K Since 2k9.  Xbox, Playstation, PC, you name it I've played it. I am a MASSIVE basketball fan. Somehow they manage to make the UI and controls even less intuitive every single year. It's really depressing considering neither Madden or UFC bring their games to PC. Just a terribly designed game.  Every year they change the controls inexplicably, and the in-game controls and menus are unbearable.  Want to replace a player in your MyTeam? You can't just switch them. Make sure you scroll all the way over to your starter, select replace from bench, seperate for collection, and then scroll all the way back.  Want to make a substituion in-game? Good ♥♥♥♥ing luck with the horrendous UI on court. You'll have to open the menu and make the sub.  Oh! But now you're ♥♥♥♥ing PF is inexplicably guarding their PG! So go to defensive subs and change those too. BUT WAIT. You can't ♥♥♥♥ing access defensive settings until the substitution is complete! But regardless of this, you have to ♥♥♥♥ing press A to go through each ♥♥♥♥ing indvidual in your active roster to find the player you want to guard him. NOT EVEN THE PLAYERS ON THE FLOOR, THE ONES FROM THE BENCH. And then you get to watch endless minutes of digital dancers and coach speak pressing A frantically hoping to just play the game.  Don't even get me started on the MyPlayer, even worse than last year. Want to be an average kid from an average family who gets good at basketball? Too bad! You don't even get your own nickname anymore. You get endless cutscenes of you as some douchbag with a dead father and a black kids voice who rose from the bottom to be named 'Prez'. I can't have the voice of an Asian, Mexican, or White kid? I can't be from the suburbs like Bill Lambeer? Oh, and the first coin pack you buy doesn't even get you enough to buy a single card back in MyTeam.  I hope this franchise dies off. Pathetic.

This game has so much potential to be such a great game. Let's give this game some time and see how this game progress from here on out. At the moment, this game needs some new content like new titles for the faction you're in for like bragging rights? Maybe perhaps allow the raiding and protecting of the space stations and colonies? Another way to secure an income for cash like mining minerals in space and selling them at the marketplace in planets? I would love some achievements too if it is not too much to ask for. An AI enemy would be nice too like an enigmatic alien race pillaging and raiding for some unknown motive could be foreshadowing for some really awesome storyline! Even a unsophisticated stats screen would be nice to monitor progress/progression. Documenting this game in its early stages is one of life's simplest pleasures that i derive from.

Upon closer inspection, it seems the vast majority of those 300 positive reviews were fake/bought by the developer. If you read enough of them you will see the same few ideas repeated over and over again in a slightly different way. The story and dialogue are as long and time consuming as they are terrible (EXTREMELY). I played three hours and spent like 2 of those hours reading text. When you do get to play the combat offered no challenge whatsoever. The leveling gives no customization choices, simply get a new skill and stats boost. I could go on and on like this but try the game yourself and you will see how bad it is. Nevermind $32 on sale, I wouldn't play this game for free, and am requesting a refund.

If you're coming here from Oblivion or Morrowind or other 'open world' RPGs, the main thing to note is that Risen is handcrafted. Every little dungeon, treasure trove, and enemy was placed in the world by a designer - and as such, it's full of little secrets.

5448788,426000,HunieCam Studio,"I do recommend this game, but only to a point. I, personally, love the style of the game. Though many people have become disappointed with it. HuniePop attracted a specific crowd of people; these people came for one thing. Similarly these people rushed to Huniecam Studio expecting the same things, but could not find them. I do not recommend this game if that is what you were looking for.  I love the art style and the new game mechanic, it adds a new spin on a clicker game by setting a strict time limit. Every step of the way will change your final score; unlike most other clicker games, which simply go on unto infinite, Huniecam Studio gives you a goal and a score. At the same time the adorable art, though limited and repetitive after a few runs, gives plenty to adore for your time playing.   The strategy behind this game is one that has been very difficult to decipher, the time limit set by the game makes it a severe challenge. That being said, the goal is to find a strategy that works; once you do, the game becomes of little challenge. The achievement base does not set a very high bar, and you can finish all of them in less than 19 hours. Recently though, the game has added 'Rock Hard mode' where the difficulty of the game is increased three fold, literally as all the girl's pay is tripled. It gives a new, and maybe impossible, challenge to those who have already grown weary of winning.  Unlike many, I did not come for a HuniePop sequel; I am glad to play a new game with the old and wonderful faces from games past.  Thank You,  Woulf",1,0

The AI is respectable and I like how each opponent has their own special trick shot to keep things interesting from one match to the next. The problem is that once you get past those first three hours, the game devolves into a ridiculous grind-fest. If you want to reach the end-game and face the final boss, you'll first have to repair your spaceship by obtaining new parts. To obtain a single new part (13 in all), you need to purchase all of an opponent's biographies via the in-game store using credits earned from winning matches. Earning enough credits to finally get all these needed parts is a process that can take literally dozens of hours to achieve. It basically feels like a F2P mobile game where progression moves at a snail's pace.

Texture Quality, AA, FOV Slider, and other common graphics options can't be changed. All you can change is resolution and Anisatropic Fliterling.

414619,18500,Defense Grid: The Awakening,"i want to say i really like this game , far better than the second one. as a matter of fact , dont even get the second one. it is not good at all. but my major problem with this game is the fact that there is no structure to the story. you can just skip to any map at any time. you dont need to earn your way by beating the current map. so to me it felt like the challenge had been taken away.  and i didnt like that at all. and now when i go back to play it, its like pick any map and play. i want to play the whole game again. but to do that i have to put myself through each sccessive map and then if i beat it i can pass to the next, even though i can pass to the next map anyway without beating it. its just not right. this style of game kinda takes away the whole point for me.  Like i just opened it and would like to play it again , but the fact that every map is just available and there is no game criteria or structure to play.it takes the appeal away for me.so i just closed it and am going to play something else. cause it just isnt worth it to me. the makers of this game made a major mistake doing it like this in my opinion.",1,0

While it may lack the graphical polish of the flagship title of The-Publisher-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named, the tense atmosphere is successfully conveyed through the fact that bullets in here are, in fact, quite deadly.

6393264,95400,ibb & obb,"I rate Ibb and Obb 5/5. Sadly, I will probably never finish it as I know no one who is able to play this game adequately.   It isn't that this platform puzzle-adventure game is difficult. It isn't very difficult. It's just that all of my friends are into playing other types of games apparently. They play RTS (real time strategy) and other things. Oh well but that's the way it goes. It can be hard to find someone who is as good as you are at a game and ALSO wants to play it with you at the same time that you do. As this game depends on cooperation (most of this game's puzzles require a high-degree of cooperation) you need to play this with someone who is as competent at the game as you are and despite how cute this game looks, there are some fairly mind-bending puzzles in this game, but that's also a good part of this game's charm.  The music in this game is excellent. The sound is good and cute. The graphics are cute. The game runs really, really well. The controls are, if you are a platform gamer, intuitive. But you MUST find someone else who thinks the controls are intuitive as well. Your mother who only plays complex scrabble-type word games and who has never managed to win a super mario brothers game won't be good enough at this and so the game will be sort of frustrating. This really is one of those games, like the cooperative mode of portal 2, where you should ideally be playing with someone you know really well and who is at least as good at the game as you are.

2408803,242920,Banished,"Was very excited about this game and after having read myriad reviews, I was looking forward to a challenge with lots of tragedy and failure on my part. I've played it for 9 hours in two sessions now and probably won't touch it again. In the beginning I restarted the game a handful of times because I couldn't get my village to survive the first winter. Loved it! I'm a total sucker for rogue-like permadeath grinds where you have to start over again and again to optimize your approach. Well, that didn't last long. About 20 minutes in, I never faced defeat again, not even close. I stopped playing when I reached year 60 with a population of 104. By then I had long built everything there is to build. I always made sure to have an abundance of resources. Quite an easy task to be honest. All you need to survive and thrive (numbers based on 100 citizens): - 2 fishing docks --&gt; fish are the most failure-proof food source - some other food production like gatherers, orchards, crop fields - 2 forest lodges --&gt; logs for construction and firewood - 2 wood cutters --&gt; firewood to fuel houses - 1 mine - 1 quarry  Probably forgot something, but that's it really. Then simply build the literary handful of service buildings (like hospital) and enough housing lest you wind up with a retirement home and no fertile youngsters for breeding purposes.  I played the game mostly on 10x speed and it was still boring and slow as f***! After a couple of hours you've seen everything and you can deal with any disaster. Got some epidemic? No trouble, folks will automatically visit the hospital and get cured. Your cattle is infested? Slaughter them buggers and cut your losses. How would that be a problem when you have 6000 fish stored (which amazingly never rot, must be some Asian fermenting technique going on).  The game is boring because it's easy, lacks content and becomes repetitive after a mere few hours. There are some mods out there which add more content, but that only prolongs the inevitable. Still a good, almost bug-free indie-effort, no doubt. If you feel like getting it, wait for a sale!",-1,0

This opens up to a new feeling when you have played the past Saint games before, it might feeling like a cheap cop out taking old mission from the previous games but the way it is introduced in this game adds a new story that makes sense. By making a story that throws you in to a simulated city of Steelport, makes it easier to go back a re-live key story moments that has lead you over the years to get to this piont this game. Having to battle aliens over data not hoods and hacking shops instead of bying them adds to whole simultion.

1903713,232790,Broken Age,"As a backer of the project, I could not be happier with the result.  I've played some great adventure games recently, but a lot of makers are relying on cautious 16-bit stylings because it's pretty easy and inexpensive to execute. Broken Age is the return of the adventure game as a primetime feature: it's all about presentation, and to say the Double Fine team has done a good job would be a tragic understatement.  The game is beautiful, stunning. It looks good in screenshots, but that doesn't compare to seeing it come to life on screen. The amount of polish they were able to put into the presentation is amazing, particularly since the last couple of episodes of the documentary prior to release gave the impression that they were struggling to get that polish in.  The soundtrack is incredible. McConnell's work complements the visuals remarkably and the orchestral execution of the soundtrack really gives the music life. Sound was clearly of huge importance to the team. The attention of the project helped them bring in some big name voices (Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, Wil Wheaton) but their execution of the roles much more than their names brings so much to the game.  The script is classic Schafer magic. You can see him in his scripts. While this game isn't as out-and-out funny as some of his classics, there are some definite genuine LOL moments in here. What I see is a growing maturity from Tim and a man who's now putting a lot of himself into making games for his daughter as well as the rest of us. Broken Age's story is fun and accessible, and its characters are very relatable for players of all ages. While Act I does end in a bit of a cliffhanger, I think the twist to it is fascinating.  It would be fair to concede that I was pre-invested in this game's success, but it's a winner through-and-through. There's nothing about this game I don't love.",1,0

Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is an RPG powerhouse. In this game, you are embraced by a vampire clan of your choice and go through late night Los Angeles preying on humans and exploring the grim city that vampires call their home. The story is to die for, the mechanics are phenomenal and the world is incredibly immersive. It's pretty much a perfect 10/10 with memorable characters, distinctive settings and replay value as each clan of vampire plays differently from the others. Two minor things put this game back: The combat system is similar to that of Borderlands and that enough should tell you that it isn't the best way of doing things (it still executes this system better than Borderlands) and in order to even run the game, you must find the latest version of the Unofficial Patch and install it.

1303769,220240,Far Cry® 3,"I played 23 hours so far. It's a fairly generous 8/10 for me.  Good looking game, and some sights are gorgeous. Having said that, this is like far Cry2 in Far Cry (1) settings. It's a go get, do this, mission quest. Unlike far Cry which was about mercs and a crazy scientific experiment.   That does make Far Cry 3 a bit of a grind, albeit a good grind. I don't see myself doing much after the main quest is over. I mean I can't see me collecting every loot chest, relic, lost-letter, etc. There is no point to it really, so that part's just a grind, because there's hundreds of them.  Liberating outposts is better than expected. Getting in and cutting off the alarm before the pirates signal help is rewarding. Plus you get extra exp for doing it without an alarm going off. Another place where it excels is missions in the main quest take you to amazing places. The sets they send you to are a bit Tomb Raider style, without the puzzles. All the up-sides then.  It is addictive. I liberate one outpost and think I'll just do another, and another. Then I might finish with a main quest mission. Then another outpost, including hunter mini-quests gained at the outpost.  If it was just a hint more Far Cry (1), I would rate it higher. Also, why oh why didn't they put an inventory/progress quick-save key on. We can go to the main menu and save progress/inventory. It's diabolical they didn't give us a hotkey.",1,0

1152266,218620,PAYDAY 2,"It's a fun game, and the multiplayer can be very exciting if you can find good players. However, too many people mod this game to make multiplayer heists easy, and most only complain if your not following their orders like a slave. Plus, DLC shouldn't cost more than the game itself. The game is fun, but if they keep pumping out costly DLC every other week, people are gonna get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I support the game for now, but that could easily change if they keep trying to take more money. Not to mention, they don't even touch the consoles. Those who own the X-Box version haven't gotten one update, which shows the company doesn't care about the players and paying customers, just that they get money. Ironic, a game about stealing money designed by a company that is trying to milk customers for as much as possible.  Update: I've changed to not recommending. They've continued to milk their customers for everything they can. I've stopped buying their dlc's awhile ago, and don't plan on getting them in the future. This game is just an easy way for them to make money without doing the work to make a new idea or game. In my opinion, the creators of payday are no better than activision, EA, or Bungie now. I don't expect they'll make anything worth while from now on, just a remake of the last game, filling it with dlc's and/or microtransactions. Not to mention, each of these companies are full of physical and mental children who need to glitch, mod, and cheat to win and feel better about themselves. This game is full of those people as well.",-1,0

1992951,234190,Receiver,"First impressions (that will probably get drowned out in the sea of review and the fact that they are at the bottom of the steam store page.)  Reciever is delightfully complex and a welcome challenge and change for any venterned fps player. The game however is very much a 'very early alpha'/prototype, but with a lot of future potential.  By focusing on realistic detail of gun usage, the challenge no longer becomes about snap reaction times with pointing and clicking, but rather the challenge comes from profecient weapon use against the simplest of enemies.  My first few rounds I heavily relied on using the help menu to guide me through the complex key presses needed to opertate my random firearm. I quickly took up the challenge to learn the keys and the appropritae sequences without relying on the guide, I dare say this only took me 20 minutes of play time to get down pat.  Despite the simplistic nature of the enemies (a drone that has to ram you and has terrible flight pathing, and a stationary turret that scans in a radial loop) Their loud 'target accquired' beeps caused overwhelmingly tense situations unrivalled by any other modern FPS. These situations were only exacerbated by knowing it was one hit one kill from these drones, forcing you to be swift and always ready.  As I summarised, the game is very earlier in development. Hopefully development continues and more content is added at a frequent pace. $5 dollars is I think a bit much for this game in its current state, but liek most early access games, its a entry bar none that gets you in on the ground floor before its worth more.  I'd say check it out if your interested in a truley new spin on fps!",1,0

Now, onto the game! + Story is stellar + The combat is easy to pickup but hard to master (can be very rewarding when you decimate a large group of enemies with some impressive combo's) + Graphics are solid, not amazing, but quite nice nonetheless + Lots of sidequest content Really great game, if you enjoy GTA then I think you will enjoy this, however acknowledge that the experience is quite limited in comparison to the experience that GTA provides (This game did come out much earlier though).",1,0

574806,203830,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav,"I got this as part of the Daedalic Armageddon bundle, and played it after playing the Deponia trilogy (which I loved) - and it does not disappoint. It's a sweet little game, with a compelling story and likeable characters. Like the other Daedalic games that I've played so far, it took me about 10 hours to complete, which is quite a nice length for a game of this type.   It's unique selling point, and one of the reasons that I enjoyed playing it so much, is that you have magic powers. The main character only has one power - to break things, such as glass. Later, you are also able to fix things. It is this constant mechanic that makes this game so interesting. It makes you think around a problem very differently - for example, you may need to break something in your inventory, then use it, and then fix it again to solve a puzzle. This, and other constant useful items such as the knife and the flint and steel, makes this game more of a proper adventure. I, with my trusty knife and my magical skills, can do anything. Well, almost anything. Some things.   The game does, however, have it's flaws. Some of the puzzles are, in my opinion, a little bit too obscure for their own good. This is mostly down to this game's tendency to give you too many items at once (that, and an inventory system which is quite difficult to navigate, rather than in Deponia, where it is possible to see all of your items at once). Too many things at once does make it a bit difficult to work out what you're supposed to use, and even if it doesn't, the solutions are not always the easiest to work out. I made it through most of the game without help, most of the puzzles were challenging, not impossible, but sometimes you just don't know what they're getting at, and still don't understand it after you've googled the solution. I don't know, I may just suck at point and click games. This is by no means a reason not to play it.  The achievement system is weird. You make certain choices throughout the game, which don't affect the story much but do get you certain achievements (if you're bothered about that). The problem is, it's not just that you MISS achievements (there're some which it might not occur to you to try to get), you CAN'T get all of them in one playthrough. The achievement system contains alternative achievements, for each and every way of doing something. This is a little odd, but it isn't really important.  The main disappointment for me was the ending. There was nothing wrong with it, in itself - but it was abrupt. I had the same problem with Deponia (although the ending there was slightly less fulfilling). You complete the game, and then... it's just over. A little bit of a trailoff, but it doesn't hang around to say goodbye. There IS a second game to play - but, unlike Deponia, it isn't just a continuation of the same story. This story ended, and I felt a little cheated of closure at the end. Not much - and maybe it's because I was just sad to finish playing it - but there were a couple of loose ends, to say the least.   No matter, I'm greatly looking forward to the next game. Hopefully it will fill in some of the gaps. The Daedalic bundle is a great buy on sale (mostly just for Deponia and this, and maybe another game or two), I'm very quickly becoming a big fan of this company.",1,0

3570697,289650,Assassin's Creed Unity,"Assassin's Creed : Unity is an unpolished mess of what the series used to be. I've been an enormous fan of the series through it's life span, playing almost every iteration of the game as it comes out. Unity is the first one that leaves me immediately and immensely disappointed.   I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with this game. I want to like it, I want to love it. I'll stop playing after it's crashed for the third time in an hour, and swear not to start it up again, but I always do. And it never gets any better. It still keeps torturing me with horrible controls, framerate and performance issues, and the sense of a game that was rushed to production.   Make no mistake, this is easily the most gorgeous game in the series to come out, but with the myriad of other issues plaguing it, I can't help but feel like this is more of a performance show, and the game has plenty to show. But, It feels like the game is unpolished and unfinished, and as a fan of the entire series, I'm immensely disappointed in the fact that this is the first Assassin's Creed game I've ever asked for a refund on.

5464225,427270,Orcs Must Die! Unchained,"My Review after over 10 hours of playing this symphony of fun and frustration:  First of all the game is still in development (beta) so of course there are bugs and all the well known things (lags, sound suddenly stops, ...) in the game. This does not count as a con like the developers are going to change and improve the game.  So when we leave all the bugs away I would say it is a very nice version of 'Orcs Must Die!' with a very high potential.  - There is still the well known rift defending mode where you need to kill all the enemys before they get to your rift/s. It is new that you can now play all modes and missions with up to 4 other players. (friends or just anyone)  - The new mode 'Conquer' (I hope its the right translation) feels very much like 'League of Legends'. Here you can either play against NPC's or other players trying to take over the enemys rift. The tricky thing is that your team needs to defend and attack at the same time. Of course you defend with your character and loads of traps. Attacking you do with spawning troops of orcs, swordsmen or whatever, leading them through the enemys traps, killing the badass guards and gates until your troops can enter the enemys rift. Furthermore there are (like in 'LoL' too) specific side tasks to do (depending on the map) which allows you to send in a boss with your troops once per task.  - What surprised me pretty much is that they built an ingame shop where you can buy new characters or equipment for real money. Of course you can chraft everything you can buy in this shop, but this needs a lot of time searching for the specific loot. But still I hate games with shops where you need your debit card. Anyways I cross my fingers hoping that they will take it out again. I more like paying for the game instead of geting it for free and then paying ingame for all kind of stuff. But I guess im not the only one with the opinion. ;)  However, I'm a big fan of 'Orcs Must Die!' and I would definitely recommend it.",1,0

Snake might as well have been voiced by an actual snake because the tiny amount of dialogue he gets is laughable, and the actual breadth of emotion used by Sutherland (who is an otherwise good actor) might as well have been a guide on how to act like a piece of driftwood.  The free roaming. Yay! I've always wanted a Grand Metal Theft Solid Auto! Thank christ they had the ability to copy and paste otherwise the map might have been one single town and one very small piece of flooring.  tl;dr: MGSV ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, it's boring, badly written, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters whose personalities could be summed up on a sticky note and what would have otherwise been a lacklustre game (if it was 20 hours long) seems to have been stretched thin across enough time wasting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that it'll suck 100 hours out of you.

1617100,224540,,"I have played this game a fair bit and I do think that it is a good game. The classes are relatively balanced and the maps are enjoyable as are the creations in the steam workshop (made using the very user friendly map creator) but the servers have gone dead. When it was first launched there were frequent updates and there were full servers, now in an attempt to bring people back (which worked on me) they released a DLC which added some classes and weapons, but didn’t really change much for the game. I still recommend this game as I have found it enjoyable to play and the building aspect I find the most enjoyable.  7/10  I discovered Ace of Spades around late 2010 when it was a brilliant free indie game and the simplicity made it fantastic. If any of you are interested in playing ( I highly recomend it) Google: Build and Shoot, or Open Spades. ",1,0

4565946,350080,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood ,"If you loved New Order, you're going to in the very least be satisfied having spent $20 on Old Blood. It offers a less linear path to completion, features an entirely distinct plot, and showcases a few new weapons. If you want to keep fighting Nazis, it's worth continuing that fight in Old Blood.  With that said, you won't be blown away. The gameplay is still quite directed, the plot is even weaker than New Order, and the weaponry, while fun to play around with, often feels way too overpowered to make the game challenging. A new shotgun you're given early on makes it mindlessly easy to cruise through chapters without thinking twice. There's plenty of ammo. Combine that with a single-shot sniper rifle (which doesn't need to be scoped to be accurate) and you have a single player experience that is going to feel like you're playing against Easy Bots in Counter-Strike where they have knives and you have an AWP. It's genuinely that simple, even on Normal. But that doesn't mean it ain't fun! It certainly is.  [SPOILERS AHEAD]  Now...let's talk about the plot. It's weak. Okay, it may even be weaker than New Order which was basically that World War II ended up in the Nazi's favor because of some crazy new science and monstrous mechanical doggies.   In Old Blood, Blazkowicz, the blonde hair blue-eyed Nazi-killing Superman, is eventually assigned the task of taking down Helga, a lead Nazi 'explorer' who's interested in finding King Otto's tomb and unlocking whatever power may be with his corpse. That's it. You'll find her in the end, but the end-game fight is easy and the mechanics of it are predictable. Shoot the beast in the face, dodge his obvious animations, and you win. The fight ends, a random brick from the ceiling hits you in the head, and you wake up to the face of the Scotsman who helped you through New Order. He hints at the next mission which is taking down Deathshead, and you're done.  Enough about the plot.   Let's cut to the point: the game is fun and it's worth playing. It takes all that's great about FPS games [excluding any multiplayer component] and puts it into a mindless, run-and-gun experience. It's better than any of the other Wolfensteins (maybe even the original RtCW) and adds more depth than most run-and-gun. Now, that's not saying much, but it should be enough for anyone even remotely interested playing another WW2-based FPS title that's a bit extreme and isn't afraid to lean on the side of ridiculous.

It manages to be different to more traditional rogue-likes and has a real quaint feel to both the art and music. The gameplay is rather simplistic but it manages to be enjoyable. I'd say towards the end of my play-time as i aimed to finish the last of the achievements things began to get a little repetitive, as you'll be encountering the same layouts and enemies routinely, but for the first handful of playthroughs i definitely discovered something completely new each time.

The story keeps your interest to the max, thanks to the narration that ties you to the main character and his mates. All the protagonists are charismatic and their expressions are just fascinating (the realism of it is just mindblowing).  The atmostphere of the 40s is there, every single little detail is there. Even though the story is linear, you never feel that you have to follow X point to Y. The investigation system with the puzzles you have to discover is just a MASTERPIECE - everything you do have an impact on the final result of your investigation. And most of all... You have to recall every single things you have seen/done/heard to solve your investigations. That means you really have to be involved into the game!  This game combines : TPS/Shooter - Advanced investigation with examination of the different suspects - 'Point &amp; Click' (you have to find the clues on the murder scene) - Open world exploration - Arcade driving...

210768,108200,Ticket to Ride,"Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC. I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC. Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good. I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues. But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10). Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked. The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say 'Play'.  The new interface works good for me (on my 47' TV). I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam. But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly. Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine. In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI. The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV. The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.  I only wish it had controller support. The mouse works fine and intuitively. I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version. It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360). But it works just fine. I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .",1,0

4997525,383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch READ THE WHOLE THING!! (First actual review of something. Don't ♥♥♥♥ me too hard.):  To be clear, I had bought this game at 20 dollars. Compared to a lot of other games that are outside my budget, I'd be hoping that this game would have just as much content as some of the other games that I've played. However, after reading some of these reviews I've noticed that people have been saying that they've beat this game in around 5 hours. My total playtime of this game was around 3.9 or 4 hours. Really? For a 20 dollar game? That really is something unacceptable and should be lowered. Comparing this to some of the other games that I've played at around this price point, there was much more story and gameplay that I had gotten out of cheaper games. Somewhat of a disappointment.  Story:  The story is very enjoyable throughout the start of the game. I liked the text box options as well as the small little tutorials in between. It felt intriguing looking at the different options and following along the story of our protagonist. However, the story mainly dwelved into radio conversations after this. The radio conversations are what really drives this game. The voices between our protagonist and another fire watch person, Delilah, were interesting and entertaining. I really don't want to spoil much else and keep in mind that this is arround a 5 hour game. Gameplay:  After hearing everyone calling this a walking simulator, I can somewhat agree. There is a lot of back tracking which can make things uninteresting when you're walking through areas you've been to for a while. The only times I didn't mind backtracking were parts where the enviornment really showed itself. I just wanted to get every look at the surroundings. I even took a few screenshots myself. Another thing about this game is that its HEAVILY story driven. There isn't anything wrong with a game that mainly focuses on story. If you aren't into games that are like this, then I'd suggest you'd stop reading and not buy this game at all. Controls are simple and are told to you throughout your playthrough.  Bugs:  I didn't find many bugs throughout this game. Only complaints I have about this were that there was a part near the old scout camp and there was a patch of grass connecting the ravine area with the camp. I couldn't cross that at all, as if there was an invisible map barrier in the way preventing me from going there. Rocks rendering their things and trees coming in can be annoying too.  Final Verdict: Firewatch's beautiful scenery combined with its radio conversations proved itself to be a very interesting game My GTX 970 ran this thing fine at maxed out settings with no fps drops. My only main issue with this game is that its 20 dollars for something that I beat in less than 5 hours. Another game that I've played, Undertale, has a lot of replay value. Its 6 hours on your first playthrough and another hour if you havent met the requirements for the pacifist run. Then you have another 6 hours until you kill youself after fighting Sans for the 105th time. Undertale goes for 9 dollars and has more gameplay than this does. I do realize I'm somewhat comparing apples to oranges with their graphics and how long each game took to make but really now. Just because I don't recommend this game doesn't mean its a bad thing. If you're planning on buying this game, I'd suggest you'd not buy it right away. Wait for a sale to drop its price. At least half of its normal price. 20 dollars for a game thats so short is almost ridiculous. Don't be like me who bought this game at full price.",-1,0

I always thought that was silly, but few times I was wondering how that would be even work for a video game.  Well. Undertale actually does it. And it does it really, REALLY well.  Undertale actually gave me a lot more than I was expecting, and I was just curious to see what quirky supercool dude Toby 'Radiation' Fox was building all along (yes, I never played the demo that was available before).  In very simple aspects it's easy to compare it with EarthBound, especially with its weirdo humor, but it really takes you to places you could not expect from not just an RPG but a video game in general.  Do not let the simple graphics fool you, you are about to have quite a ride.",1,0

I love Sid Maier's Civ series, and I've tried a couple of times to get into GalCiv, but it's just too dated, slow, and uninspiring. This is one of those titles where people who like it, like it a lot, and they'll gush about it and give it positive reviews, while the rest of us just shrug our shoulders, go 'meh', and really don't see what the big deal is.  The graphics are not only dated, but that's to be expected, I can look past that, I mean I still play a lot of older games. But they're just too simplistic as well, even back in the day this would look crappy. The music and SFX are actually really horrible tho, so bad that it actually stands out lol.  There's a lot of content to the game, by that I mean in game mechanics, the tutorial is VERY large - maybe too large, but there's ZERO in game help, no tips suggesting what to do next or what steps you need to take to accomplish your mission. So you can waste a lot of time building and researching one strategy only to find out you need to take a completely different path /wasteoftime.  If you like this game, good for you, but for new players - there's better options out there, this game is just really, really boring.

Skyrim and Morrowind have a far more interesting setting, not to mention a less broken leveling system, and Daggerfall is the best RPG in the series, bar none. Oblivion is just kind of... there, at the bottom, with nothing making it better than the other games in the series in any way. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but the others are better in every aspect.  That said, Sheogorath is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.

4208813,32370,STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™,"'Savior, conqueror, hero, villian. You are all of these things... and yet you are nothing. In the end, you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.'  (This review contains spoilers.)  The original KOTOR has what I believe is the quintessential 'Star Wars experience' out of all the franchise games released to date. Mixing the gold-standard Bioware gameplay and character arcs before they became overused and predictable, a focus on exploration and discovery, respect to the SW lore and a strong attention to world-building and detail, it's a game that still stands the test of time and is recommended for any fan of RPGs.  As much as I'm a fan of KOTOR II's cerebral, relationship-driven, 'take every trope and turn it on its head' gameplay, I still think the first game is the better of the two. The mystery of who you are, what your relationship is to the squadmates and enemies you meet in the world and how you grow to encompass that reputation again (whether for good or evil) still sticks out in the post-KOTOR world of cookie-cutter games like Bioware's own The Old Republic, which only has a superficial understanding of the choice and consequence that went into the former.  The plot is fairly straightforward. You are an amnesic man (or woman) who wakes up aboard a starship, having been out for several days and coming to just as it is being attacked by the Sith. Narrowly escaping with pilot Carth Onasi, your pod crashlands on the city-world of Taris, where you begin investigating the circumstances that led to your foggy memory. Along the way, you'll pick up a starship (the Ebon Hawk) and meet crew members like the murder-happy HK-47 assassin droid, Jedi Masters Bastila Shan, Juhani and Jolee Bindo, Mandalorian soldier Canderous Ordo and Wookie renegade Zaalbar, among others. All this comes to a head as you uncover the true identity of the Sith leader Revan and assault a space station called the Star Forge in order to stop Darth Malak, the man who took up Revan's job and threatens to destroy the galaxy.  This game has some of the most 'pure' Star Wars moments I can think of. The moment when you first step out into the Dune Sea, and see that vista all around you and the smoldering Sandcrawler in the distance. The trek through to the lowest levels of Kashyykk and the civil war going on between the various Wookie factions. The underwater walks under Manaan. The reveal of Revan, backed by that epic score.  While the player being Darth Revan is a plot twist that is firmly in 'It Was His Sled' territory as far as spoilers go, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one bit despite knowing about it long beforehand. There's so much content to see and do that it really felt like an enjoyable and fulfilling role-playing experience. Whether it's doing some of the sidequests (like getting involved in ruling family squabbles or doing assassination contracts) or just running through some of the areas, there's a wealth of material here for fans.  It's true that the storyline wanes a bit by the end (not counting the potential Dark Side twists like convincing Zaalbar to kill Mission or the Bastila reveal), but it still didn't mar my enjoyment, mainly because I brought a pair of squadmates specced out for long-range combat (Canderous and Juhani) and went in guns-a-blazing in the Star Forge.  The morality system can also be exploited to great effect (you can get to full Light Side or Dark Side in less than half of one playthrough), including doing things like maxing out your LS points than choosing Bastila's Dark Side option at the end to still remain 'neutral' but get her as a squadmate for the Star Forge finale.  If there's one thing I hated about the game, it's the inventory system. You WILL pick up a lot of vendor trash in this game, and I found it was far easier just to dump or never pick up most of the gear I found, sticking to one weapon until I found something significantly better.  It's also much better to spec your character manually, because the auto-level system is nigh-useless and will often result in your character gaining abilities that either aren't class-specific or generally have no benefit to you.  Regardless, KOTOR (and its sequel) still stand out among the best sci-fi RPG's in recent years, and the price point is a steal, regardless of whether it's on sale or not. If you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to check this out.",1,1
4928263,379720,DOOM,"If you want the short version, its great. Fast, fun, gore and guns. This new version of doom has many nods to its predecessors while adding some new elements to make the gameplay something all its own. Keep in mind my review is for the single player because thats what I want a doom game for.  There is a heavy incentive to preform a lot of melee kills. I personally like this feature, once you get rolling you'll hopefully enjoy intergrating it into combat seemlessly. Some people fear the melee kills getting repetitive but i feel they made the animations quick enough and the benifits relevant to avoid that possiblity.  Pros: Looks great Level design combines well with the fighting engine to make fun fights Wepon mods give weapons more versatility Collectables and upgrades encourage level exploration  Cons: If you die multiple times at the same point the reload time can be a bit grating Sometimes the level will block you off at the end so you can't go secret hunt post clear  Fast paced demon slaying action with truly impressive presentation, this game exceeded my expectations.",1,0

About halfway through the game, you get 'bombs' and a 'loupe' which let you alter certain constants in the game's code. Unfortunately, you can't change the flow of a program beyond altering TRUE / FALSE statements or switching '=' to 'not =' and visa-versa. Oh wait, you can actually also change strings, including which procedures are called... It's a shame that wasn't the solution to any puzzle, and you only have to modify strings in one room(spoiler: it's in the tutorial on how to use the glass /spoiler).

1325320,220780,Thomas Was Alone,"Thomas Was Alone probably sets the record for 'lowest-budget to biggest-heart' ratio in a game. And if not, it's pretty high up there. Now, don't get me wrong, when I say 'low budget', I don't mean it's half-♥♥♥♥♥ in any way. It's actually really well made - rather, the look of it is purposely lo-fi. You play as a red rectangle named Thomas whose goal is to make it through a series of 2D puzzle-platforming levels. Along the way you'll also meet other colored rectangles, each with their own unique abilities and personality. And that's all I'll really say about the plot. Suffice it to say that you will be amazed at how much you'll actually care about a bunch of little rectangles. That is due in equal parts to the writing and the well-done narration that accompanies it. As for the actual gameplay, it's good, but very easy. The levels involve puzzle-solving and platforming, but neither aspect is even remotely difficult, except perhaps in a couple of spots here and there (which I would classify more as tedious than hard). So this is not a game you should buy looking for a challenge. You should buy it if you are into indie games with unique looks, story and ideas. It's a great experience, all around - a perfect casual game to while away an afternoon. The game will take around 3-4 hours total, including all secrets, so it's not very long, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome. Definitely check it out if you like these types of games.",1,0

4657667,359320,Elite Dangerous,"Without getting into a long-winded review: I loved this game. It's worth the money I've spent on it. It takes me away to a realm that I will likely not see in my lifetime, nor my children's lifetime. I took into account all of the dangers that lie in space. I took into acount the massive amount of time it would take to get the ship that I wanted. But I think I took too long playing it without a solid party system, waiting for yet another title that wasn't 'complete' yet.  Tread lightly with this title. It's worth every penny, but I don't know if it holds the longevity that I would have liked to see initially. The Power/Politics system didn't inspire me to do anything except take a long trip out of Federation space to reach my chosen faction. I found no reason to support my faction other than the potential at grind rewards. Grind rewards aren't bad but I felt with all of that space out there, I'd rather become an explorer, bounty hunter, trader, and ship connoisseur.  8/10 See you space cowboy...  ***After the addition of Horizons***  The planetary exploration is very smooth and delivers on everything the developers promised. There are even missions that correspond with surface deliveries. However I would appreciate more land vehicles and the ability to customize them. I will say, it is an amazing experience driving around on the surface after spending so long in outer space.  Get it while it's on SALE! Especially if you already own the base game.

3367128,275850,No Man's Sky,"This is a game that not everyone will enjoy, well to be honest most average gamers will not enjoy. There is a lot of repetitiveness in the core game mechanics so if you are easily bored don't bother.  But, if you enjoy exploration, weird &amp; wonderful creatures, Beautiful planets, spacey stuff &amp; mining then this game is for you.  Personally I have had little in the way of performance issues, even less when I installed the new Nvidia driver catered specifically for No Man's Sky(As well as other new releases) The game has crashed twice for me(My playtime is more than 12 hours, closer to 30 hours as sampled this from other sources prior to being able to afford it) I have had no major FPS drops and usually see 40+.  Despite how much I have enjoyed the game there is things which I feel could make it even better and I'm sure Hello Games will be working on new features as I type.   The below is things that could be improved.  Maps &amp; Waypoints - To have a map on each planet would be amazing as the size of the planets is massive and trying to find a specific area again is quite difficult(Especially trading posts)  Combat - No difficulty facing the sentinels even with a starting Multi-tool. Some variety to the sentinels would be good, only seen 2 so far and one only when I found Vortex cube spawn planet(Which is amazing for units)   Space Combat - Needs improvements, can be difficult to track enemies and hard to turn around. A lock-on system maybe?   The above can easily be fixed and I'm sure they will, Hello Games have sorted a lot of the problems out since launch despite massively unexpected sales and their servers being pushed to the max. They are only a small team but I can tell they put a lot of care into this game and want it to be as good as it can be.  To sum up, I love this game and will continue playing for sometime.

2986456,259600,Finding Teddy,"Before you buy this game, you need to know that it relies heavily on audio puzzles. Many of the puzzles require an English alphabet to music code. It can be extremely frustrating if you don't know that the sounds relate to the alphabet or if you can't tell many similarly sounding notes apart. I do not recommend this game to anyone with audial difficulties.  That said, this game is a cute, magical adventure full of death. It has the usual pitfalls of point and click adventure games - repetition, back-tracking, 'why do I have this object?', use everything with everything, etc. - but it also has frustrating sound puzzles. Honestly, I almost gave up on this game because of the musical code puzzles. It does have this odd charm about it. Once I got past the frustrating bits, I ended up enjoying it. This is a game that takes a lot of time and thought. Unless you use one of the community guides.",1,0

3565706,289130,ENDLESS™ Legend,"Endless Legend manages to add some fresh new ideas to the 4X niche. Those aren't revolutionary, 'forget-everything-you-previously-knew' kinda ideas: they are small steps in new and interesting directions for the genre. For example, Endless Legend divides the map on regions, and each region can have a single city. This makes it aesthetically very pleasing, limits the capacity of ICS ('infinity city sprawl') tactics, and acts as a catalyst for conflicts. Similary, Endless Legend take on Luxury Resources is the best one I've seem yet among similar games: you collect and stockpile them overtime (after you build the relevant extractor improvment in a resource node), and you can spend them for a temporary boost of happiness plus an aditional modifier that varies depending on what luxury resource you used. For example, a Gold Mine might yeld +1 Gold/Turn, and you can consume 20 golds for a boost that gives 5 Happiness and -50% upkeep costs for ten turns. But, for me, by far the best thing about Endless Legend are the main questlines. Like other Fantasy 4Xs, Endless Legend has quests... but the differences here are twofold: one is that they are actually very well written and interesting and, more importantly, each faction has a different main questline that is pretty long and can easily grab your attention if you seek to complete it. The quest objectives for main questlines are varied enough, and closely tied-in to the story being told. Completing it is absolutely optional, of course, but it is directly linked to one of the victory conditions in the game (the Wonder Victory Condition requires you to finish the main quest). Those main questlines give a very good reason to play at least once with each faction, the narrative is worth it.  I have two complaints about Endless Legend so far: one is that while the UI is generally pretty good, it lacks information on a few topics. Some of those can be found on the manual, but I believe that every single game mechanic should be clearly explained by in-game tooltips and such. My other complaint is that the combat AI doesn't feel very polished, making the combat a bit less pleasing than it could have been.",1,0

5394654,417860,Emily is Away,"This is a game that thrives off of nostalgia, in a good way. My god, every little detail, from the computer humming in the background to the usernames of your friends, are spot on for the time and just bring back crazy old memories and feelings.   The game gives the illusion of choice, but it is enough and effective enough to make you fee llike you are talking to an actual person. The scripting is great. The problem lies with the lack of actual substantial choice. You make decisions on the way, but none have any actual lasting impact on the story, so they're pointless and just serve to strengthen the illusion.  Some choices really hit home though. I'm in an engineering school, have a crush there, hated high school and parties, and more. These details really served to strengthen the impact this game and its story had on me. I was completely immersed for the course of the game.  The ending is depressing and not great, but the more I think about it the more I realize how true to life it is, and how that final detail is what really grounds the game to reality.  For anybody who lived as a teen in the early 2000's, this is definitely worth playing.

Lots of secrets to find and plenty of replayability with the Leaderboards.

1058849,217100,Dementium II HD,"Sigh. It's really such a shame to say that I wouldn't recommend this game.   I remember seeing this game for the Nintendo DS, but I never got a chance to pick it up. And then this game come to PC with the 'HD' version on the title. Saw the negative reviews on the front page but it really can't be that bad right? Since it's horror and everything I figured I might as well try it myself.  The term 'disappointment' is a horrible understatement. I didn't expect much graphic wise since it is a port but despite the HD upgrade on the PC, the graphics are still behind the times and everything about it feels outdated. The gameplay is probably better for the Nintendo DS but abysmal for the PC and it's not just the gameplay, it's everything. The sounds repeat for each monster type, the combat music is the exact same loop and the ambiance music is the same. As for the story, well there is a little to no story in the game. You can pick up notes and things but even they do not offer any kind of story, just hints on your current situation. Trust me, there's more story on the description page than the actual game itself.   The monsters are the same warped grotesque things we have seen in the entire Silent Hill franchise and the terror effect no longer exists. Enemies act and look the same to their type. Again there is no explanation for these monsters and why they exist. Most of the game takes place in prison walls, and while there is the occasional town to break up the scenery, most of the game looks pretty flat and dull before long. Colors tend to stick to realistic browns and grays, and while the monsters show some different colors, even they often stick to darker versions of bright colors. Everything looks drab as a result, and the lack of variety in the locations only makes looking at the game that much less interesting.  The walking speed is the speed you should be when crouched or laying down in other games and the run speed is the walking speed. You must hold down the run button the entire time you play but it's okay since you have infinite stamina. You can pick up health pills, medkits, adrenaline shots and poison resistant bottles but I never once used the shots, bottles or medkits and only a couple times used health pills. You can also get a flashlight that flickers on and off constantly, but when it's on a weapon, it stays on.  And then there's the bug. Oh yeah, the gamebreaking bug. You see, I've been playing for three hours and it's all fine and dandy. After encountered the second reanimator monster, I got teleported into the other world and fight against five of those face-spitting acid monsters. Done my business there and finally back to normal world and guess what? I can't get outside of that toilet room! I've tried running, crouching, jumping, slashing, shooting at the open door but the game still won't let me out. There's a machine gun ammo there but it sure as hell didn't help. So here I was thinking, eh maybe I can reload a few saves back and the bug will be gone! But nope, the game decided to say 'Well son, that's what you get for not listening to the negative reviews on the store page! Now you get to experience it yourself.' And as you can guess, the bug is still there. At this point I already gave up trying and decided to write this review.  It simply baffles me how they can slap High Definition on this when all that was done was barely touching the graphics and adding cutscenes. Within three minutes you can predict when monsters will apear and how the game is going to go pace wise and gameplay wise. And it seems after all these years, the developer didn't even bother to fix their game. The lesson here? Listen to the other reviews before buying anything and it will save you so much time and money. There are dozens of other, better shooters and horror games for your money — ones that make better use of PC controls, sound, and graphical power, so you’re better off steering clear of this game.",-1,0

Telekinesis and Terraforming is a real friend as you navigate through puzzles, finding unreachable areas and rewards. I have yet to see any action in Multiplayer, but maybe with the game's full release, thatll change.   However, because of my obselete graphics card, its a little difficult with clipping lag. You'll need a more modern day GPU to better enjoy this. Also the other issue is being careful as you target single objects for TK as the reticle is pretty precise.   Overall, using the powers of Gods to dispose of obstacles has never been so fun and challenging. So I would give this game a shot since it's just $20.  ",1,1

4303979,331600,ONE PIECE PIRATE WARRIORS 3,"Alright. I'm a huge One Piece junkie. I've been waiting for this game for quite some time. But I'm also very adamant about my video games so I'll do my best to stifle my bias for just a little while so I can discuss some pros and cons that I see evident already.  Pros: The game plays smooth. I have a decent rig 2.8 Ghz i5, 8gb ddr3 gskill ripjaw, 4gb EVGA Nvidia 970gtx, and a 3tb hdd. I've never hit a hiccup and I wouldn't really expect to with this set up. So if it doesn't play smooth for you, don't shoot me for saying it runs well on mine. Personal experience.  It holds very true to the story. The depiction of the canon story hasn't been done so faithfully in any other iteration of the franchise that I've experienced yet. There are mini events you can trigger which work outside the norm such as [Spoiler!!] Iron Mace Alvida showing up in the first Buggy mini arc when she didn't team up with him until after Buggy got btfo the first time. [End Spoiler] That being said though, it isn't immersion breaking.  Combat depth and combos flow very smoothly and it doesn't feel 'jumpy' like I did in One Piece Unlimited World Red.  Stat complexity and customization is very deep and you can adjust particular characters stat priorities in any way you'd like to fit your (or the characters) play style. Of course, this isn't too big of a deal if you're playing on easy or regular because the game is easy on those settings, as it should be. Playing on hard should ensure a level of challenge to the point where character customization is something you should pay attention to and not 'auto assign' your tokens.  The cast! Any fan can appreciate the number of playable characters which have their own unique spin to them that depicts their fighting style or devil fruits very accurately to the manga/anime.   Now time for some cons.  I won't sugar coat these because they irk me.  I use an Xbox One controller. But... for some reason, all the key prompts on the screen are still stuck as if I'm using my keyboard! This is immensely annoying for someone trying to start with the gamepad seeing as there is no real correlation between what button POSSIBLY COULD BE and what is mapped to the keyboard. So upon trying the game out on a gamepad for the first time, you'll have to do some trial and error. Which I did and I accidentally released my Kizuna Rush while there weren't a lot of enemies around. Annoying! Pls fix.  This game is near impossible to play on the keyboard. This gets a line all of its own. Then again, this game was developed for consoles and controllers so take that as you will.  Its a PS3 port! Noooooooo!! I didn't spend this kind of money on a computer of this caliber, to have Koei Temco port a version of the game from last gen. I'm very disappointed in this.  And finally, the lack of an online co-op mode. This would have been a fantastic place to allow One Piece fans to meet and mingle through different mediums!   All in all, this is a good game. It feels good, it looks and runs good, and it holds true to the One Piece story that we all know and love so much. Our favorite characters are portrayed very well and it SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPERRRR satisfying to lead a huge group of enemies in line for a massive 100+ KO special :p Keep in mind that this is a fan game. Most people who aren't interested in the One Piece universe probably wont be picking up this game but if there is someone who you want to get into the story and hasn't been receptive, this could be a perfect opportunity to invite them over for some 2 player local co-op to ignite that beautiful spark and pass on this story to even more people.

The tutorial did not work at all for me, even after deleting and redownloading the game. Couldn't find much that was helpful on the forums in terms of explanations. Decided, what the heck, I'll wing it. After sitting there for at least twenty minutes, clicking things and trying to figure out what things made what other things happen, I kind of had things figured out. But... there wasn't really a point. With no guide and fumbling around to figure out the gameplay mechanics, it just felt like pointless clicking. So I deleted it.

There are complaints about fps when zoomed in, but honestly it's fine. Remember that film runs at only 24 fps and consoles are often 30 fps. Higher frames only matters in action games. I see no reason to lower graphics for more fps because most of the time you're not zoomed in, and when you are it's to look at the well detailed units   Graphics  Besides excellent unit detail it's nothing special. This isn't next gen TW  Gameplay  The campaign is much more directed and linear than previous TW games. This is a turnoff to many players, but there are mods to address this and it's more accessible to new players.

I got the game on sale and I still think I could have found a better use for my money than this.Ccombat is annoying and does not flow like in Batman, most of the time I was looking for ways to avoid it due to overuse of counter attack. So for most hand to hand combat, which is like 90% of the game, I simply got a truck and roadkilled the enemies. Story is somewhat interesting but every single thing revolves around hand to hand combat. Driving camera is bad, and driving model itself is not much better. There is some assasins creed like exploration involved but it is not nearly as good as even the first AC was. Overall this game is a dissapointment, if it either was more GTA like with guns readily available or had a melee combat that worked like Batmans than it could be fun.",-1,0

668701,206210,,"This game is great. It no longer uses GFWL like the original paid game, but it has fully integrated steamworks. It's like a faster paced call of duty but everyone has a lot more health so you don't die in 2 bullets and there's actual gunfights. There is much more freedom of movement due to items like grappling hook, gliding cape, high jump shoes, etc. The game has a wacky and comical style to it that doesn't take itself seriously at all.  On top of all this, this game is not Pay2Win in any way. Everything that matters to gameplay can be unlocked just by playing. Everything that is paid DLC is only cosmetic items or to skip the grind, and there isn't a lot of grind to begin with since you can get the loadout you want within a few matches. The game is pretty good in terms of this PC port, as it even has FOV options  Overall it's just a really fun game. I recommend it to anyone that likes multiplayer shooters.",1,0

1839811,230700,La-Mulana,"(all my reviews are labeled as 'Recommended' because I don't like the label system)  La-Mulana delivers what it says it wants to, it's old school.   Unfortunately, this brings the problems of old school gaming.  In terms of actual gameplay, the game's platforming is a bit different from the norm. You can't control your jump trajectory except at the beginning of your jump, and you can barely control your falling direction.  Then comes the real oldschool part. The puzzles. Where you not only have to think outside the box; but also flip the box upside down, chop it open, and analyze it with a microscope.  The hints offer only slight indication of what you need to do.  At first it seems pretty simple. The first puzzle presents you with a hint to kill two red skeletons, you kill the skeletons, which unlocks a block needed to complete a puzzle. Fine.  Then they start getting a bit obtuse. You get a hint that the mouths of two statues are connected, ie. pushing a block in one will push another out the other. Only the perspective doesn't fit the block you are shown, and you have to hit it with your whip.....And there has been no indication that your whip can affect these blocks.  You get a hint that the geometry of the temple is messed up. Apparently this is supposed to refer a secret passage right behind the hint that leads you to the other side of a map.  Sometimes puzzles activate things in adjacent rooms, sometimes they activate things 4 rooms over.  This is the first level alone.",1,0
4663550,359320,Elite Dangerous,"A great space simulation experience.   This is one of the few space games available in the last couple of years and so far is one of the most engaging games of its category. There is almost no limit to what you can do in the game and as the game promotes: 'Play your way, Blaze your own trail.'   In the visuals department this game can blow you away. Never I have been so close to a star and really feel threatened by its magnificent presence, never have entered a planet ring and see all those asteroid up close that looks like giant countries floating in the vastness of space. Never had the perception that even traveling faster than light it still takes quite some time to get to the nearest celestial body from where I am. The ships range from flying bricks to beautiful eye-candies but you will always be in the cockpit of the ship.   The game doesn't have a story, at least not a narrative, personal story with a beginning, turning point and an end. Is a simulation where you do whatever you want. You choose the role you want to take in the galaxy. Some are criminal scum, some are the hand of the law; some are honest trader, some are dishonest smuglers; some are adventurous explorers and some are despicable pirates. Everyone has an impact in the grand scheme of the game. What is your impact is up to you.  The controls can be as good as you are willing to make them. I know that a good control from the start can leave a great impression to the player. This game lets you customize the many details of the control scheme and you will not have the perfect scheme the first time. But the game is very friendly with keyboard &amp; mouse, Gamepad and Flightsticks so no matter which control you use it will keep evolving as you keep playing and trying different combinations to do the job.   Outside the game there is a great community in Steam and the official forums willing to give you hints and tips to overcome obstacles the game throws at you. Inside the game there is also a great community willing to go by your side to complete the task you are doing. But there is also the threat of being the target of a user engaging in player versus player combat. And all that is good. You can also create private groups, and go solo with no other players and have the galaxy for you.  I’m not going to lie. This game requires time to master and time to get immersed but once I did it, is the most enjoyable game I have in my vast collection. If you are going to invest – yes I said invest – your money and time in this game I suggest to do the homework first. Read some reviews, watch some gameplay videos, watch the official tutorials so you can know what to expect from this great game.  I really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys space and job simulation games, flying games and space combat games.  ",1,0

5969472,550,Left 4 Dead 2,"With different campaign and versus modes, L4d2 is great for multiplayer games.  The game doesn't expound on story, but basically you and your team try to survive the zombie apocalypse. You make it from safe house to safe house until a final stage, where you must hold out until rescue arrives---then run like hell to get to the choppa! Each campaign is amusingly interpreted as a zombie horror movie, hence the posters on the loading screen and ending credits. Character development isn't a focus of the game, but the characters do have funny sound clips.  I only play campaign, but no run is ever the same because the AI scales difficulty to your party's skill extremely well. Made it to the first safe house without a cinch? Here's a hunter to the face and a spitter when your teammate is trying to revive you! And I can't tell you how many times a smoker strangled me when I strayed too far from the party.... Be sure to pay attention to special mob sounds.  Hilarity ensues when you mess around with the environment. You know, when you 'accidentally' molotov your friends or shut them out of the safe house (HUEHUE). I'm pretty sure I once accidentally killed all of us by blowing something up. The occasional bug can be enjoyable too, like the time we got a witch that walked back and forth on the street. Yep, good times.  Difficulties for campaigns can be changed mid-campaign by voting. There are many different weapons and items to suit various player preferences for FPS.   The original Left 4 Dead is also great, but L4D2 has more variety in enemies, weapons, and game modes. I believe L4D2 has L4D1's campaigns. As with the first game, L4D2 has a plethora of user-generated map mods that you can download by subscribing to it on the L4D2 Steam Workshop.",1,0

1768038,228400,ACE COMBAT™ ASSAULT HORIZON Enhanced Edition,"Listen. I grew up on flying games like Top Gun: Combat Zones, Jetfighter, iF-22, and later HAWX, Ace Combat 6, and Sky Crawlers (an INCREDIBLE piece by Project Aces). One thing these games all had in common is engaging, fast-paced, and straightforward dogfighting that demanded precise control and a keen wit to spotting enemy maneuvers and countering them to your advantage. I grew up with these learning to dogfight using only the stick, yaw, and throttle to create dynamic dogfights and neverending fun. The unlimited freedom of flight is really why flying games are my favorite.  READ: THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES.  Fair warning: I will vent. HO' BOY AM I GUNNA VENT-  The game opens on a dramatic cutscene-SKIP JUST LEMME FLY I DONT NEED PLOT I NEED PLANES-and a storm of fighter jets over.....Florida...? (NO ACE COMBAT GAMES ARE SET ON EARTH HNNNGGGGGGG WROOONGG) You drop right into combat and you're in your jet! Cool! Can I shoot things now?  NO YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS GREAT NEW THING WHERE THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF FOR YOU CALLED DFM (DogFightMode)  Oh okay, I'll give you the benifit of the doubt. Flying games have always had some wierd new mechanic to make them 'unique' (gotta admit though, I love playing around in the 'Assist Off' mode in the HAWX games). So this fresh new thing is basically a dogfight autopilot that forces you to tail an escaping enemy. Cool, I guess. You just hit B a few times to launch the (booming echo) NONDESCRIPT HOMING MISSLE THAT OPERATES PURELY ON DFM MECHANICS. Some (booming echo) CINEMATIC EXPLOSION shrapnel fly into your engines and your (booming echo) GENERIC GRIZZLED WHITE MALE PROTAGONIST says he wants to check his systems. Cue generic control tutorial. *gasp* CAN I DOGFIGHT NOW CAN I CAN-  ...nope just go into DFM again and do a gun tutorial  ...now?  Nope! More autopilot! And this time a bunch of bad guys fly directly in front of you solely to get themselves blown up LIKE FRIGGING SPACE INVADERS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE *deep breath* Okay, that was boring. Game wants me to use DFM again? No, screw you game, I'm doing my own thing and dogfighting old school like I payed money to do! *long silence*.....what...why....I can't... I can't.... kill them...  I PUMPED COUNTLESS MISSLES INTO EVERY ENEMY AND YOU LITERALLY /CAN/ /NOT/ /KILL/ /THEM/ /OUT/ /OF/ /DFM/ That HAS to be only the tutorial, righ-NO.  ITS NOT JUST THE TUTORIAL.  YOU CAN'T KILL ENEMIES DUBBED AS 'ACES' UNLESS YOU USE THE STUPID BORING DFM AND I'M NOT SWEARING FOR STEAM'S SAKE BUT CHRIST I AM ON THE INSIDE. No really, I tried. They all have infinite flares that never fail and even if you manage to bait them with one missle, wait for flare, and fire another while they can't deploy more, YOU CAN HIT THEM /ENDLESSLY/ AND THEY WILL NOT DIE  I SPENT TWENTY MINUTES ON /ONE/ GUY AND JUST LOADED HIM WITH MISSLES ENDLESSLY AND HE WILL NOT CRASH. This is the point where I said 'screw this trash' and shut the game off.  Did I mention that the tutorial leads directly into a rail turret mission? A RAIL TURRET MISSION. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECT ACES WHAT ARE YOU DOING. THIS IS A /FLYING/ GAME. YOU MAKE /FLYING/ GAMES. I DIDN'T PAY REAL CASH MONEY DOLLARS TO HOLD RT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AND ENJOY THE FRACKING SCENERY.  I don't even wanna KNOW what the AC130 missions other reviewers mentioned are like.  Few more nitpicks from a flight sim/arcade vet: The stalling mechanic is just your nose falling. Yeah, that would have been acceptable in 2002 ON THE PLAYSTATION FRIGGING TWO. You know, I seem to remember a real-feeling stalling mechanic IN A GOOD ACE COMBAT GAME. All that happens when you brake while turning is you move a little faster. There's no smoothing or feel of a real plane decelerating and slowly tightening its turning radius or any kind of physics at all. It blows my mind that all the things I HATE about this game were already features IN PREVIOUS GAMES THATS NOT HOW PROGRESS WORKS-  tl;dr: Sorry I really needed to vent all that. If you like arcadey, almost shmup action with all kinds of cinematic flair? This game is for you. If you like flight sims or ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS ACE COMBAT GAMES THEN NO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY. I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle because if I had paid $20 for this I would probably sue Project Aces,  God... I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a game that I have to just stop playing to avoid future embarassment. I've never written a review. This made me so upset that I sat down and wrote a two-page, 850 word review about how disappointed I am,  Out of ten? How low does the scale go? Because that's my answer. Screw this game. Uninstalling.",-1,1

I have a few ups and downs in the game, being that surprise attacks are far too easy to get with the help of your cursor-based partner, and ambushes seem really random when they happen, especially when I can clearly see the enemy and walk into it before it's even midway through its defensive animation. I personally would probably not have designed a boss where my main character is basically overpowered for the boss itself... maybe just for the additional enemies have the light-attacks stronger, but for the boss itself it shouldn't need to have been quite so easy. (I played on casual mode, but it felt way too easy even for casual mode... almost anticlimactic.)",1,0

4782825,365890,Heroes of Normandie,"Let me start by saying I have the boardgame version of this game and enjoy playing it. From reading the game manual, the goal of the game is to recreate the mechanics of the boardgame.  The reason I had to go to the manual was due to a faulty implementation. Sound in the tutorials does not work, all I get a buzzing sound. Certain user interface components overlap, making it impossible to access what lies under the top layer. Cards, an important component in the boardgame, are not yet implemented. There is no way to control graphics or sound through the use of a settings or options menu. [There is an options menu which gives two sliders that are not labeled. Message to the developers: this is rather useless.] (I'm running on an Alienware machine that meets all of the requirements for this game.)  After trying a different machine, I was able to try the tutorials and get through them. There are typos and some other minor issues, but overall, it plays reasonably well. However, the lack of cards is annoying.  Update: I just tried the 1.06 patch and it's a big improvement. The game plays a lot better and the feedback from the game is a lot better. Since they are updating regularly, I'm going to assume the cards and other fixes are coming and I will change my overall review to 'recommended'.  Overall, this game appears to have been shoved out the door a month or two before it was really ready. I have hopes that these issues will be addressed by the developers, however at this point I cannot recommend it. That's a shame because I was looking forward to the game.",1,0
2301156,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Great game really. I love this ''Nemesis'' System, and hope it will be explored further. It does have it's limits though. It gets a bit repetetive. But you'll always have tough enemies to face. unfortunately, these enemies can all quickly be dealt with once you've leveled enough.  It's a big world, and as such, it will have a few bugs and glitches here and there, you can't expect even the biggest team of developers to find all bugs. One being the mounting of a graug from a ''leap of faith'' height, which will result in an awkward camera view (yes, taken directy from asassins creed, luckily it's only what I call it, because it's similar, except you don't need no stinkin haybales)  As for gameplay? Great, the controls work really well for me, and it's a good thing that using your bow slows down time around you, otherwise it would be damn near impossible to land the kills that I do sometimes. Parkour works great and also to your advantage in a fight. And your enemies will actually yell orders to one another, speak to one another and complain about how you're beating their sorry behinds. (for example, if you fight them on a mount, they'll talk about killing the mount first, then you, or shooting you down from it, and much much more) The graphics are decent, but now overwhelming, but I can look behind graphics and appreciate what's behind the cover. Story wise.... the game doesn't go very deep here. I felt a better connection between me and the girls in the fable series. And that is a big minus.   The game is decently hard. But once you get the hang of things. it gets too easy. I was aimlessly running around mordor on my graug mount, literally beasting any captains I came across that didn't have ''hate of graugs'' those that did, i'd kill on the ground with ease. Combat is easy, but fun. However, if you're looking for a challenge. don't. And if you LOVE good endfight battles. you DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES want to buy this game, it have been ruined by quick time button events. (yes, that's right, winning the endfight is done by mashing a few buttons at the right time, no fighting, no superhard enemy, no horde of minions during it, just one stupid quicktime event.  All in all, it IS a great game, and if you love asassins creed, you will love this game as well. At least I did. But the game has some serious issues, which could have, and should have been different *cough* final bossfight*cough*  and then there's the last issue. I have not played any of the DLC's, but I do plan to eventually, however the fact that there are so many DLC's forces me to do another big, fat minus. (yes, I hate DLC's, but buy them anyways if the game was good enough) DLC's are not cool. They prevent you from playing things that either could have, or should have been there from the start, but + 1 for not making any dlc's essential to playing through the game. And I bet some of them have been requested, or inspired by players. Which also earns a bit of respect. the devs are listening to their players.   I do recommend playing this game, but I don't recommend paying full price for it, wait for it to be on sale somewhere. I would have felt cheated for 40+ euros. I demand a game that'll knock me out of my socks in sheer awsomeness for that price. And this game, didn't quite hit that mark. But I was impressed  Middle-earth Shadow of mordor, earns a 7 out if 10  It's not the best game I played, but it's one of them. And this nemesis system? It's something else for sure, but it's not been polished yet. Worth checking out, but you aren't missing anything special other than the nemesis system if you don't. ",1,0

I myself have forked out money for it and I was happy with it untill you get bored of it, Continue to run this and that get the gear and guess what? New content 5$ please to continue.. If you wish to subscribe I really recommend doing so early on or untill you get your first level 30 character or you will be held back severely limiting your character to about 40/50 combat rating. Now I'd be happy to continue playing this game if they did somthing with all the lockouts from content, Such as release a demo version of it like they did with the wonder woman event you get access to the content but with longer lock outs for loot, I wouldn't mind that at all and it'll give newer players a chance to try out and get new gear and not be locked behind a wall and quiting soon after or paying to just continue to repeat and not touch it after a set combat rating because theres no use.. I'm not kidding, Once you get to a certain cr you have no reason to go back in to the instance unless ofc your helping a guild or friend out or the off toon to level up.

999593,214490,Alien: Isolation,"First off, the good elements of the game: It captures the feel of the original alien movie very well. It is genuinely tense in many parts due to the atmospheric audio and sound track. The graphics side of things are also quite impressive, the game is fairly nice to look at. However my expereince so far of the game is overall disapointing. It is by no means a bad game, but it does not quite live up to the expectations. My biggest complaints are as follows:  Firstly, you learn very quickly that the game is a console port. As a result the control of your charcter in the game does not feel as sharp as a pc game should. However this is a fairly minor complaint and the game does allow you to turn off aim assist to limit the horrible feel of a console game.   Secondly, and probably one of the biggest problems I had with this game are the enemy characters and the AI. The game features not just a big scary alien, but also hostile human and synthetic enemies. I first encountered the armed human enemies who I decided to try and avoid as this stealthy style of game play seemed to be what the game was all about. This method worked fairly well most of the time, but when I found myself in one situation where I needed to get passed a room full of eneimes I failed every time. I kept getting discovered and gunned down wether I used distrations or tried different routes when trying to sneak passed. I lured all my enemies and hid in a vent, but rather than continuing on with thier search they all gathered arouned the door near the vent I was in as if they knew they couldn't attack me because they hadn't techinically found me yet, but they also didn't look any further past where I was hiding making it impossible to slip by. At this point I was so sick and tired of trying the stealth approach that I leapt out of the vent and charged my hunters with the crow bar like weapon. They all noticed me and raised their guns but since they were all standing so closed to eachother only the enemy directly in front would attempt to attack me. The others just stood there waiting thier turn while I slowly clubbed each one to death. In the end I mananged to fairly easily take out 4 guys with guns by myself with a crow bar.  On that point, the guns. After killing all my armed enemies I naturally thought, woo I can hoard all thier shiny new guns. However I was wrong, the game only allows you to kick the guns around on the floor that have been dropped by your conquered enemies. You have to wait untill you get to the room with the special gun just for you because apparaently that is the only weapon you know how to pick up.  So from this I learned that the AI in this game was not necessarily as intelligent as the sales pitch made out. Next I encounted the android or synthetic enemies. There was a moment where you are hiding in a vent and the game shows you a random person being attacked and killed by a synthetic. This I figured was the game telling me, 'ok so the synthetics will attack you now ok?' However since by this point I had a gun I decided to have a crack at one I found by himself. I shot the robot in the back of his head which understandably provoked him. However no matter how many more bullets I unloaded into his face he didn't go down. When he finally cornered me I discovered they the synthetics are also capable of catching almost every hit with the crow bar making it useless to attack them as well. I know these characters are supposed to be robots not people, but why give me weapons at all? This encapsulates my main problem with this game over all. The game is difficult in a really lazy way. You get weapons and guns and the like only to find out that in order to stop you being rambo, the game simply turns off the effect of these weapons on most of the enemies. Robots come at you even if you fired enough bullets that they should no longer have a head. However this lazy neutering of the weapons is worst of all with the feature character of the game, the alien.  Obviously you can't just kill the alien because there is only 1. However, during my first few encounters with the creature which were actually quite tense I always managed to sneak past him. Finally howver there was a moment when he saw me from the other end of a long hall way and immediately charged towards me. I pulled out my selectively useful revolver and fired off round after round thinking I could distract or stun the monster for a moment to make my escape. However the alien wasn't too bothered and charaged straight on at me. In fact my bullets didn't even seem to exist when fired at the alien. Literally, there was no impact animation or anyhting on the alien it was as though I was firing blanks. The game essentially says, 'no you can't kill the alien so we are just going to turn your guns off when you use them against our baby' It really feels as though the guns, or at least the ones that fire bullets, are in the game specifically for use against the other human enemies only. Again this game is by no means bad, just not as good as it could have been or as it was marketed to be. You quickly become aware of the limitations and controls the game places over you so that you play the way it wants rather than how you want.  ",-1,0

1505311,223100,Homefront: The Revolution,"Well I feel I must explain, there is alot of bad reviews and mixed reviews on this game, but it isn't from the gameplay it all has to do with the optimization, This is what I have to say ' The game looks beautiful, voice acting is awesome, cutscenes are awesome, having the option of going stealth or guns a blazin is a nice touch. I have played just over 2 hours now and I can see that it might get a little repetitive but what quest based rpg's don't at some point. I think the bike is a little hard to drive with mouse and keyboard, but pirfect with controler, there is a lot of moments that make you feel like a bad ♥♥♥, so I would rate this (10/10 would kill NORKS again), lol no I would give it an 8/10 though.

It plays smooth and only have a couple of frame drops when switching between scenes that dip to like 15 fps for a breif second.

788956,209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Batman Fans Rejoice! The Prequel for the Batman Arkhamverse is now here. Origins is set in the early days of Bruce Wayne as Batman. Although it says 'Origins', it is well over two years from the beginning of his vigilante crime fighting. In this game, you will encounter a lot of 'first' as you battle enemies, and established alliances.  Its story may lack the intensity and direction unlike the two original arkham which was written by paul dini. However, the game still delivers quite a compelling story. The game starts off rather plain but once you get to the middle part, that's where it kicks in.   Gameplay is identical to the previous games, but with some new features like gadgets, and a new class of enemies. The game is beautiful in terms of its graphical presentation. The only problem with this game is the amount of bugs and glitches it has that seem to destroy my immersion throughout the game.   In addition, this game now supports multiplayer where you will be facing joker's and bane's thugs as you get to play as Batman or Robin. But to be quite frank, the multiplayer doesn't live up to its expectation and fails in giving you a good gameplay.

5537514,433920,Aveyond 4: Shadow of the Mist,"I have been a long-time fan of all the Aveyond games--they've followed me through childhood--and playing Aveyond 4 as an adult has been a great way to come back to the series. Each of the games is their own experience, and while in certain narrative ways Aveyond 4 feels like a regression, as far as gameplay goes, the series has grown in some fantastic ways. Though I feel as though the protagonist was the wrong choice for this game, the game maps are extensive and rewarding, and the arc of the game is smooth and fulfilling. The way the game plays is excellent, and the narrative aspect mostly provides context for how to view it, so although I was largely disappointed in the story of the game, I loved Aveyond 4 as a whole.  Overall, I had a great experience and would wholly recommend it. That said, this review is largely narrative critique.   THE NARRATIVE:  Narratively, Boyle felt like the wrong choice for the protagonist. He is not engaging as a main character--the humor regarding 'retired villains' and 'heroes' fell flat, and it felt reductive. The best part about him was his relationship with his dog, but that dedication is not enough to make a protagonist. An attempt at humor regarding evildoing in a comical tone is not enough to make a protagonist, either. While the backstory about how he found his dog as a pup was touching, it does not offer strong enough motive for him to be the main character of this story. He is mostly a static character. While he does admit that doing good is pretty good, it is dulled by the joke of it all, and the retired supervillain aspect diminishes the entire relationship of good and evil. Basically, it seems as though he was truly good all along, and the only amount of growth is in his awareness of this, and it is not enough to drive an entire game. His personal stake in this journey is not, narratively, the strongest one.  Boyle is looking for his dog; Myst is looking for her brother. In order to find his dog, Boyle must find Myst's brother, who was snatched by a demon. Even the game's title, 'Shadow Of The Mist', suggests that Myst is the one with more to lose, here. Boyle plays the reluctant hero, but it is irritating to have what feels so much like Myst's story filtered through this flat, reductive joke of a retired supervillain. Myst has never been away from the mountain, and while she also needs to find her little brother, she longs to see the sights outside of The Mist. She has so much to learn, so far to go. She has the most reason to go on this journey to defeat the demon and save her brother, and she has the farthest to grow. She is the most dynamic character, at a tipping point of her life.  If Myst were the main character, the framing of this game would've been much more powerful--and it would've offered a kind of serious beauty to it, too. In that way, it would mirror Aveyond 2, which was personally an extremely successful, gorgeous game with a very gentle, fairy-tale like story. This still would've been light-hearted in (many ways, and a grand heartfelt adventure, but it would've also had the background context of a fairy-tale. This game could've so easily been absolutely incredible, beautiful, had Myst been the protagonist. She has every reason to be. Also, her background as a Myst Wraith is so much more compelling than the dull, simplifying joke of the Retired Supervillain.  THE GAMEPLAY:   The maps are beautiful. They are detailed, extensive, and so very rewarding. The chests are set up so that they can be seen when strolling on the most obvious paths, and while it does take some challenge to look for them, it is not to the point of frustration. Taking the effort to go the long way around for a chest that was seen ten minutes earlier is always worth the effort. The color schemes of the maps are brilliant, well-thought, and the layouts of all the buildings are varied, textured, not tired and reused. Each part of the journey has its own distinctive map which feels like its own little area within a larger world, which helps create a better idea of this lush, full world of Aveyond. The only complaint here is that some of the maps are so ambitious that they lag on soe systems. I also loved how purposeful all the sidequests were; everything was important.  The battle system is set up in a spin of the traditional turn-based system. It makes battles so much less tedious. Each character has a different role in battle, with their own pros and cons, and it is very fun to think about how best to use each character. Myst has a few different abilities, including a healing and shapeshifting one, and using these abilities does not require a cost of mana or skill point, although it does mean that these abilities aren't as powerful as ones that would have a cost. Boyle's darkness points are replenished with physical attacks, and he uses these same points to cast magic, and it is very fun to have a wizard type who is also a formidable physical attacker--in addition to his minion, whose attacks add additional damage at every turn. Those are only two of the characters, but all of them have roles that aren't so simple as deducting a mana / skill point cost. The character battle roles are fun, and the battles demand a measure of attention that makes it so they aren't a matter of grinding through the same predictable battle rhythm again and again. It's more fluid than that.  The only thing I would say is that there are many characters who get introduced too late in the game to really develop an affection for them, or a feel for their role in battle, so they don't get the opportunity to shine. It's more difficult to care about them, when there is so little time to get familiar with them.  LASTLY:  In a lot of ways, I do not think Aveyond is the right arena to even attempt deconstructing Heroes or Villains--that seems more the space of cape comics and games inspired by those. It felt odd and uncomfortable to reference that type of Hero vs. Villain relationship in a largely original, fantastical world such as Aveyond. Also uncomfortable in the game was the way sprites from popular anime series appeared in prominent side quest characters, as if, no one would notice Hetalia sprites or Chi from Chobits acting in ways that seemed to serve no purpose, no reference, to their original series at all. It was not right to include representations of those licensed designs in this original game being sold for its own profit. Original sprites should have been made by the Aveyond team. Both of these aspects broke immersion of Aveyond as the world of Aveyond, an original fantasy world with, largely, its own mythos which does at times reference outside ones, like Aveyond 2 and the Snow Queen, and moments like referencing the Fruit of the (Greek) Gods (a pomegranate) in Aveyond 1.   In terms of media representation, the Aveyond series made such an impact on me as a kid realizing that girls and women were powerful, complex characters, and to see them in positions of power, as heroes unqualified by the acts of men, it was incredible. And honestly, if I wanted to play a game about a man, I'd look literally anywhere else. That was one of the first reasons why Boyle failed as a protagonist for me. He has nothing to add to the conversation. He is not refreshing in any way. There are countless characters like him, and there are so few respectful representations of women in games, especially Fantasy ones known for their trope of women as reward for the (male) hero's triumphs, damsels in distress, or as vile and petty temptations of evil.  All this said: I loved this game. It may be because I played it most recently, but it was my favorite game to play. But, narratively, it doesn't compare with Aveyond 1 or Aveyond 2 and the way those games stayed in my heart. I still had a blast, though, and am looking forward to replaying it  *Disclaimer: I received a free Steam key for this review, and I originally got the game elsewhere.",1,0

It's fun, great idea, the feel and premise behind the game is lots of awesome...but I'm not sure why they're releasing new characters and maps when the original game isn't stable enough to play.   It takes upwards of 15-20 minutes to even get into a game lobby, thats if it doesn't kick you out of the lobby as soon as you get into it and then you start the wait again for another lobby. Once you get into the game after a few minutes the glitches start. Sometimes they're humorous and although annoying don't keep you from playing but in my experience, more often than not it causes the game to crash which also means you loose all your progress and any of the in game rewards you put into the encounter.   There are so many bugs in this game and it's really frustrating. This is worse than some Beta or early access games I've played which is ridiculous for a game that's SUPPOSEDLY ready to sell!!!

3563460,289090,Ampu-Tea,"This game attempts to comically recreate Surgeon Sim in a stereotypical British manner. The premise seems like great fun. But the harsh reality is, this game belongs in the trash.  As soon as you launch, you're greeted by a nice splash screen with the controls, and a diagram of the robotic hand. That's very nice, and all. I approve of that.   On closer inspection, the controls are about as ergonomic as one of those cheap silicone keyboards. F1 to F5 are various menu things, like restarting the game, and changing difficulty. I'm not particularly fond of this, as using QWER for the hand doesn't make much sense, when Surgeon Sim is more ergonomic, and makes more sense.  Difficulty is changed simply by adding one more step to making your tea, which makes sense. I can't complain there.  The graphics feel cheap, and misplaced. Some are fantastic, some are blurry, and look like they're in low-res.  I'll also like to note that the noises your hand makes are so annoying, I just up and muted the game from volume mixer.  Additionally, I'd like to note that I grabbed a cup, and my hand clipped through the mug, threw it into the air, and my hand continued to spin for 10 minutes, until it fell off.  19/10.

585106,204100,Max Payne 3,"Sadly this is the most disappointing game in the Max Payne series. The awesome bullet time mechanic from the previous games is made to be less useful in this game than cover shooting.

Also, with the exception of specific story encounters, your bullet time meter will always empty extremely quickly limiting drastically how much you can enjoy bullet time in the game. On the other hand this game has it's moments, when it remembers that it is a Max Payne game... killing some enemies in slow-motion and watching their corpses ragdoll away is very enjoyable ... also graphically it is very pretty, if a bit demanding. But (unfortunately) that is all it had going for it. I haven't been so disappointed by a sequel of a well respected game franchise since Diablo 3.

Unlike shooters like Counterstrike, Insurgency excels not only in it's multiplayer PvP, but in it's co-op game modes like Hunt and Checkpoint, where players either have to eliminate the enemy AI situated throughout the map, or proceed forward and capture points to progress. The AI in these modes are ruthless and cunning, and overcoming them requires real teamwork and communication.  Insurgency also has an implemented Steam Workshop support, and the modding community has a plethora of available weapon skins, maps, and other downloads to help keep the game fresh. While the game has a varied and wide selection of weapons available, I hope in future patches and updates they add extras, but that hardly takes away from the game experience.",1,0

Dota 2 has over a hundred unique heroes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the game does not pressure you into learning every single one. However, if you want to become skilled at the game, you should probably learn and play every hero. Dota 2 is a highly competitive game, capable of bringing out the worst in people, but also capable of making you feel like a real winner.

3019284,261530,Lifeless Planet,"I really tried to like this game, and I really want to recommend this game but unfortunately the gameplay ruined the experience.  Gameplay-wise, this game offers almost nothing but jumping puzzles. And most of them are tedious and artificially difficult. I can understand that the creator wanted the player to feel alone in a vast, lifeless planet. This interactive experience does a bad job being a game, but delivers on other aspects. The story, atmosphere and music is good but you can't judge a game by its story, music or atmosphere. It is a 'game' after all.  The pacing of the environment and story is very good. You never feel tired or bored in one location. The levels, in terms of aesthetics, are unique and you are never stuck on one level too long. You aren't stuck because the game is too easy. The puzzles aren't hard, clever or well designed (in my opinion). And the pacing of the gameplay is also pretty bad. In the beginning you are introduced to your oxygen-meter, which by the way is non-existent. The first thing you do is struggle for air, and when you do find a supply, the game tells you that you have 8 hours of oxygen. This number is of course not real, and you could potentially spend an eternity without ever needing to find a supply of oxygen. This is important because the game are hinting that you have to survive in a lifeless planet. But there are no survival-mechanics in this game (if you don't count the fact you can die from enemies and other dangers). You get other abilities such as a mechanical arm that you can only use on specific devices. You only need your mechanical arm about 6 times though-out the game, all feeling artificial and an excuse to call them puzzles. The second ability you can get is a yetpack boost that gives your the ability to jump 7 more time in the air. You get this ability when you need it, but your gas supply magically disappears when you don't have a need for it. It felt like I was doing the same for 4 hours.   This game is also badly optimized. I tried to play this on 'Good', 'Beautiful' and 'Fantastic', but when there are too many objects, or a huge structure the framerate drops like a hot potato regardless of what setting you play on.   So what you have here is a walking and jumping simulator with an interesting story, good music and atmosphere. But why did this game has to be made? The story, music and atmosphere could very well fit in a movie. I am not saying you should not buy this game at all, because it was an interesting experience, but I just can't recommend this game because it's supposed to be a game and it failed to be that.",-1,0

Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so.

5372462,412740,Audioshield,"9.3/10 - In my opinion the best VR game available for the Vive.  PROS: The replay value of this game is very very high (which is very very rare among VR games nowadays). You can try new songs over and over by picking from your audio/video collection on your hard drives, or you can even search for a YouTube video and play it. Every time you play the same song, the same orbs will come in the exact same pattern, so you can play songs until you master them, or just pick new songs every time.   The competitive online aspect of this game is also very high, as any popular song has a leaderboard. The leaderboard is different whether it comes from your hard drive or from YouTube, but there is a leaderboard to compete against on any popular song either way. I even found that some of my favorite songs by relatively unpopular artists (by bands like Opeth, or Infected Mushroom) had one or two people to compete agains on the leaderboards.  Out of all the games I've played for VR since I got my Vive a couple of weeks ago, this one seems to give you the most exercise WITHOUT the chance of hitting objects in your real life space, or tangling/unplugging a cord in the process.  I was skeptical of this game before I purchased it that the orbs wouldn't be in sync enough with the music to enjoy it. I was very wrong. They obviously have a pretty advanced algorithm for making the gameplay match certain notes in the song. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more the orbs go to the song. Of course on easy mode its hard to see how the notes are going to the song, but thats beacause easy mode is there to teach you, not to make you feel like you're part of the song.  And the best part about this game is, even when you master a song, and can hit 100% of the notes, you get an 'Artistic' score. I have found that this is based on how you are moving in correlation to the rhythm of the song. When I am jumping around and dancing to the song while blocking the orbs, I get a much higher artistic score than if I were just standing there carefully blocking the orbs as they come.   CONS:  The feeling of personal achievement and progression is very limited with this game. You can compare yourself to other players that just so happened to play the same song from the same source (HDD mp3 ID tag/YouTube), but it ends there. There is no 'campaign' type system in place that you have to beat in order to progress.  There are no tiers to see how well you scored (like all the good rythym games have in place). A star system (1-5) stars would make this game more endearing, but unfortunately it just has a score for your % of notes hit, and a modifier for Artistic value (If i hit 100% of the notes I get a 10.0, and can only surpass other 10s on the leaderboard by having a higher artistic value)  There seems to be a bug with some songs that make it almost impossible to hit all the notes at the start because of a bpm change that somehow basically superspeed rush a bunch of notes at you so fast that its impossible to block them. It seems like a bug and I'm sure it will be fixed eventually.    ----------  What I think should be added to this game:   * A campaign mode that the devs made with songs they chose, where you can actually fail a song if you miss too many notes too fast (like GH/RB), and cant continue to the next few songs until you pass 2/3 or 3/4 of the songs in that tier.   * A campaign builder mode where you can make your own setlist (with only YouTube songs, to make it easier to program) and upload it that follows the same rules as the devs campaign; you have to beat the songs in order and not fail, in order to unlock the next songs in the setlist.   * A list of recently played songs (24 hours?) by every Audioshield user. This would encourage people to try out and be expsed to new songs that people have already played, so they're guaranteed to have at least one person to compete against.  * A star power type system that you can get by hitting difficult note streaks that either makes your shields bigger or makes both shields able to block either color note for a short period of time.   * User imported arenas/Arena Builder mode  Anyways, this game is the epitome of fun, and it really allows you to thoroughly enjoy all your favorite music on a whole new level.",1,0
4970727,382970,,"I like this remake. I've owned most of them. The Best being Risk 2, the worst: Risk Factions.  The new animations in this Risk version are entertaining and look nice in HD. It's solo AI game is a blast. I've read so many reviews poo pooing the game that say 'you can't click through the AI turns.' They attempt to imply that the AI turns last a very long time and that you have to watch AI dice rolls for hours on end. Either these people never played the game or simply dont understand how to play. THE AI USES FAST DICE MODE ON EVERY ATTACK. Read that line again. When the AI attacks another AI, you just see the victory of the Winning AI either conquering or defending the country. So the AI turns go really fast, no dice rolls to watch what-so-ever! Players can use fast attack dice mode too when attacking AI, so it goes really fast this way also. In fact the only time you actually have to roll the dice is when you are defending against the AI or attacking/defending against another player. I found the rounds go pretty fast.   I'm reserving judgement on this game until they fix the net code for multiplayer, and add a solid player matching service. But for the price you can't beat it as a solo game. Perfect for long trips with a laptop in plane or a car. For me its a 7/10 as is.",1,0

2222090,239820,Game Dev Tycoon,"His game is a wonderful nostalgia trip, with some minor flaws.  The graphic is nice and a little reto the music gets a bit annoying after a while.  Gamplay is solid, with some minor issues. The game roughly separates in three phases: Garage, small time developer and AAA-Studio.  The first phase is easy and was my personal favourite: You just make games you like and combine new ideas, without any boring micro management.  The second phase steps up the difficulty a notch: You move into a studio and hire staff to make even bigger games. Suddendly you have to maage much more stuff and cash becomes a serious issue. Do you burn money on a new game-engine or concentrate on churning out games.  The third and final stage is a bit easier in my opinion: You hire more guys and concentrate on AAA-Titels, enlarge your studio and develop stuff like steam, you own consol and convention and so on...  My complaints are that after the time seems to 'fly by' at phase 2 and 3. Consols come and go and you almost have no chance to develop anything for them so you stay at one system you know well (the PC) and stick with it.  You have to train your avatar and staff using reseach points, which are not to easy to get in abundance. When you have enough research points and a trained staff at the final phase the game is almost over.  Some of the user interface is also no designed perfectly, but that may be my personal taste.  All in all a fun little experience with potential.",1,0

1055151,216260,Don Bradman Cricket 14,"This is the best cricket game ever developed.  When i first played it, the experience just swept me off my feet. I was thinking if its really possible to develop a game with so much realism.  Batting seems as if we're really doing it. In order to score runs, you've got to apply yourself. Also one could play all the possible shots in the cricketing notebook.  Edges are very realistic which was never done before in any game.  Fast bowling is a real charm with all the subtle variations possible. Although spin bowling bores me personally, its also good with all real variations.  Overall, Its an excellent game which must not be missed.",1,0
1463905,222420,THE KING OF FIGHTERS '98 ULTIMATE MATCH FINAL EDITION,"While I would recommend that people who are, like me, interested in fgighting games but not very good at them start with KoF XIII, KoF98 is certainly worth your time if you fancy something a bit more complex, featuring as it does 3 core systems and over 40 characters. I only occassionally play it compared to KoF XIII's solid mechanics and KoF 2002's insane roster of characters but KoF98 has a lot of little charms that are missing from the latter games. The stages are more characterful and change between bouts with all sorts of little details hidden away that they didn't seem to bother with in the later games. There's a lot more character interactions before the start of rounds which is an excellent way of fleshing out who these characters are and how they relate to one another without resorting to sometimes lengthly dialogue excahnages as you get in KoF XIII and Blazblue. It's probably the toughest of the KoF games on Steam and because of it's multiple systems, has a lot more depth to it but it also has some of the most overpowered characters as well (Orochi in particular).   The bottom line: If you're a casual fighting fan like me then KoF 98 offers a good roster of characters and some of the best visual design in the genre (which is why I like it) but KoF XIII is generally prettier and a lot easier to get into.",1,0

2555292,247730,Nether,"The good the bad and the ugly - An review of Nether  The Good - Nether is an interesting beast, it has all the elements in place to make it a fantastic game if the developers commited themselves to improvements and not flushing out their microtransaction store they could be on to something. With some alteration to the combat animations (As in more of them so it doesn't feel so static) and a good fleshing out of the NPC quests, weapons, and world events this does have a potential to be a good game.  The skill trees - I've found myself enjoying the hell out of these, building characters for very different things. I've jokingly nicknamed my package runner 'The Kenyan' due to a maxed out sprint tree and whooohhh boy does it make a difference. You can actually specalize which is a major improvement over their past games.   Hear me out here, I know its by the same gentleman that did 'Infestation survivor stories/The War Z' which was such a catastrophy that steam had to pull it for an extended period of time. It looks like he may be learning. The NPC combat with the teleportation mechanic is actually interesting and outright horifying, this is a massive step in the right direction (Case in point, if running in the subway while a surge is occuring on the surface... the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s warp down into the subway because of the noise you make and they damn well try to kill you). The NPC's are actually pose a threat, they are highly agressive and mechanically they can make life a living nell (pun intended.) - If a dozen + world events and monsters were added to the game, more weapons diversity (and animations) were added, it could be a very good STALKER-esque game.  The Ugly - the luggage - Hammerpoint interactive/Nether/TheWarZ/Infestation Survior stories all operate off of the same engine which has extreme limitations graphically. This by itself is not a bad thing but coupled with the history of the publisher it raises severe concerns. This is the massive problem that almost all gamers are going to have with Nether is the baggage it brings with it and the bitter taste of TheWarZ/Infestation survivor stories.   The Bad - The playerbase (initially) &amp; Repititon - Before clan assignment you really are just some random schlub. Your life has utterly zero meaning or value outside of a of 'loot pinyata.' The good news is that generally clan members do not attach each other. There is also a problem of 'A lack of things to do' at present outside of scavenging and outpost defense/reclimation. This is where the last game also failed. There need to be additional events added that force people to work together to survive the mess that the world became in Nether. It's unfortunate that they might never see the light of day.   Overall Summary  5/10 -   Good - Decent engine, interesting and engaging enemies with their mechanics, decent pvp.   Bad - Can become repetitive, PC's often kill players who've not picked out a clan. Combat animatons need to be fleshed out. Game needs a lot more content to flesh the story.   Ugly - Developer reputation - After The War Z (Infestation Survivor stories) they seriously need to finish this if they want any chance of continuing as a developer. If they do not finish this and make it into something then there is a good chance that too many bridges will have been scorched for them to ever try again.   ",1,0

3925534,306760,Obduction,"I have played for about 9 hours so far so thought I'd leave a quick review which I will continue to update as I play.  First of all, the game is gorgeous. I mean it. From every shiny barrel to the scarily realistic water effects. This is simply one of the best looking games on the store right now. I did struggle to get it to run well on maxed out settings at first, but I eventually found that disabling Vsync almost tripled my frame-rate; so I suggest doing this if you are having problems.  The story seems interesting to say the least. In short, you are sucked into a mysterious land and have to figure out why you are there and how to return home.  The world is massive, there looks to be a whole lot to do and this might take you some time to discover all of its secrets. You'll find yourself walking around huge contraptions just wondering what on earth they do. It's very magical and exciting. There's a LOT of walking to do and it is extremely easy to get lost, but once you unlock 'short-cuts', travelling is made a lot less tedious.  You'll be introduced to various characters along the way, however interactions with NPCs can feel somewhat uncomfortable. FMV doesn't *really* lend itself to well to a full-3d game, and I think Cyan knows it. The majority of NPC encounters occur through 'projectors' placed within the world which are essentially video logs. Watching the story unfold through these projectors actually works pretty well, and disguises the fact that the real-time actors don't really 'fit' and the projectors give the characters a reason to be two-dimensional in a 3d world.  On occasion you will meet a character face-to-face, and this is when the effect is somewhat lost. I am over 9 hours into the game now and I have only met one character in person - and he has a very choppy outline from where he has been 'cut out' of the footage, and will 'over-step' the bounds of the camera that recorded him on occasion, resulting in part of his body/clothing being clipped. He also has slight green tinge from the green-screen and a general weird blurriness.  You solely interact with this character through a small opening within a door. Presumably Cyan has chosen this route to force your perspective.But when potentially the only character you will ever meet first hand is behind a door and is hounded by an array of glitches and bad effects, it does somewhat make you feel disconnected from the rest of the people in the world, which is a shame when previous Cyan games did this so well.  I am so glad FMV has been revived for this game, it's always been a big part of Cyan's legacy, but the process of bringing the characters into the game could have been polished.   This gripe is easily forgiven though as the game as a whole is simply beautiful. There are also some really nice touches including a wealth of graphic options, and even the ability to change the gender of your character's shadow. Point-and-click mode is also an option which will please a lot of Myst and Riven fans.  I am really looking forward to continue my quest!",1,0

1299858,220240,Far Cry® 3,"Far Cry 3 is an interesting return to form for Ubisoft.   What is it? Well it's adventure to put it bluntly, and it seems like they geared the whole game around it. Adventure, action, survival. It's plot bares very interesting similarities to 19th century adventure stories like Treasure Island, with the protagonist having to face pirates and psychologically grow stronger as a character.  In terms of gameplay the game is fundamentally very similar to Far Cry 2, but at the same time very different. The plot structure is more cinematic and focused on story. Adding to that, animals are much more heavily focused upon. The game introduces a crafting system and inorder to carry more guns and ammunition you must skin specific animals. This actually makes the game very interesting with how you hunt animals in the overworld and breaks up the monotony of killing pirates fairly effectively.  That's not to say the game is without flaws. While the protagonist is portrayed as an everyman, even on the hardest difficulty you are death incarnate outside of cutscenes. Adding to that the game's sidequests are more or less just 'Kill this particular enemy with a specific weapon' or 'find this particular animal'.  Ubisoft designed the world very effectively. Overall it's kill pirates, get money, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es. Not necessarily in that order.",1,0

4455673,342890,Synonymy,"Firstly, this is a mobile port to PC/Mac, so the controls are very basic keyboard &amp; mouse click. I experienced some overlay issues within the game when I was reviewing the tutorial and wanted to interrupt it to go back to the main menu. There's no intuitive 'esc' to main menu, or anything similar. This is a straight up port, so you have to 'swipe' back to menus through the arrow or AWSD keys.   The gameplay itself is quite simple to pick up: you start with a word, given the definitions, and set off with a completely unrelated word to find your way through synonym choices to get to your target word. Remember those 'change one letter at a time to get from 'Bear' to 'Cake' type word puzzles?' This is exactly the same only with synonyms. If you click on a middle word, you are given the definition, and just randomly clicking on words may increase your vocabulary but it won't necessarily get you to your target word. With weekly challenges, and an ability to give a fellow player a code to try and compete against one another, Synonymy is a nice change of pace to other word games.  Gameplay isn't complicated (outside of the word-linking; puzzle-solving) but your mileage may vary with the controls. It is, after all a straight from mobile port, so you may find you prefer that interface than your PC/Mac.  As of this review, the Steam Overlay doesn't work with the game, so you can't screenshot, etc.   The game does however feature a set of 5/5 trading cards (this isn't yet referenced in the Store Page).  Also of note, is this is listed as a 'non-profit' game. Proceeds from this game go to Richard Dawkins charities which are listed on the game's actual website (store page has a link) and worth a look if this sort of information is important to you.  I recommend this game purely based on its educational value and change of pace gameplay. There is some longevity to it, depending on how much you like to play with words :)   Pick it up in a bundle or on sale.",1,1

1979716,234140,Mad Max,"Mad Max is one of those solid mid-tier games that got pushed as a AAA title and shoved out to die, and that makes me sad.  I'm not going to pretend the game is flawless, hell, two times in playing it I fell through geometry and got trapped, and I'm well aware of things like the 'your map vanishes forever' bug that got patched out before I began playing (I waited on that fix), Mechanically, though, it's an enjoyable game hampered by a few design decisions. The combat's a bit repetitive by endgame, but your moves basically turn into a lot of shortcuts to victory and the shotgun is a huge boon in that it'll OHKO all but three classes of enemy*. Vehicle combat is cool and you can build the Magnum Opus (your ride for the game) into a variety of different styles: I went light armor, fast movement, and a lot of harpoon/tire-spikes to take out enemies, with a massive ram for a stylish finish. Someone else could just turn the car into a tank, or take careful shots at an opponent to blow them sky high, or spit flames from the car to consume anyone else nearby. It's a decent customization level, and that's one of my biggest issues with it:  You don't get a lot of toys until the very end of the game, doubly so if you're like me and do a lot of side-content before main events.  Which sucks! And while the story missions do put together some nice scenarios and events, I actually think some of the side stories are better designed or more interesting than the main game. The only really, really distinct thing the game did for me in its main story was the final gauntlet, which was actually kind of unpleasant to play through even though I can't fault it from a character standpoint. Meanwhile, the side missions and some of the camps took on a whole lot of environmental storytelling, from underground oil refineries, to the almost puzzle-like nature of some of the scrap hideaways, to scaling an old power structure to take down a warlord in his own home.  The thing that leaves me most disappointed in this game is that this is one of those games that would be perfect with one more revision, they take this finished engine, tweak it a little, and spend all the time of a sequel on design rather than coding, but it's pretty much guaranteed to never happen, and I don't see anyone mining this game for ideas when the next Big Thing comes around and vehicular open world debauchery is going to be forgotten. It was really fun. Buy it.  * shielded, huge dudes, and one specific boss fight where the dickweed dodges shells",1,1
5910802,507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,"Since Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation is a bigger, better version of the original Ashes of the Singularity, I am reposting this review as it is entirely applicable to this new version.   Ashes of the Singularity is a real-time strategy (RTS) game at an epic scale based in the far future.  What is Great about this game:  - Very strong RTS game mechanics with solid tactical and strategic elements - An elegant combination of various other great RTS games (Supreme Commander, Company of Heroes, etc) but still with an authentic flavor of its own - Incredible replayability and playstyle variety - particularly in skirmish mode - The unit management for such a large-scale game is second to none. Put units into an army, and they simply work smartly together. No micromanagement! - Micromanagement is at a minimal level for a game of this scale. Armies are generally smart enough (assuming decent unit composition) to actually follow orders and execute on them relatively well - The games visuals and tech are amazing. The Nitous engine (which is what this game runs on) is a beauty and looks so lovely that I switched graphics cards to run it better  What is Good about this game:  - Good unit variety with excellent hard counters (e.g. Apollo &gt; Bomber &gt; Zeus &gt; Apollo across several different combinations of units etc) - Dreadnoughts look and play amazingly - good depth and satisfaction to their upgrade tree, just fun to watch blow stuff up - There is almost unlimited skill-ceiling even against the AI as the skirmish AI is quite excellent - A good game of skirmish can feel epic and still be done in 30-60 minutes  What could be improved in this game:  - Some of the controls can be a little fiddly: - The dreadnaught upgrades can be a little tedious on very large maps. Would be nice if there was an icon in the GUI similar to the idle engineer icon to simply auto-find them and select them to upgrade faster with less hunting, even if you find them, can sometimes be hard to select the exact ship among a large group - The AI can be tough even at lower difficulties until you learn the game pretty well - Would love more large skirmish maps  Conclusion:  This is simply the best skirmish RTS game to come out probably since Supreme Commander. And even so, the devs are working on it constantly to improve on the game, and the progress continues to show. If you like RTS games, and particularly RTS games that focus on the skirmish mode or large-to-epic scale RTS games, this game is really second to none right now.  9.5 / 10.0",1,0

5397896,417860,Emily is Away,"I'm just about the right age (late 20s) for the format to be incredibly nostalgic for me, so it had points right away there. (I used to spend so much time on AIM.)  When I realized that you type out the messages by hitting keys, I thought that was kind of cool. It's kind of fun to just type randomly like a guy playing a 'hacker' on some dumb TV show, randomly mashing keys and somehow making stuff happen anyway.  The story takes some interesting turns. I've only played it through twice, (I was curious how certain choices would lead to different outcomes.) Some of the changes were really interesting, though the story still followed a similar enough format that I wasn't interested in seeking out all the different versions. (I feel like it could get tedious after more than a couple playthroughs.) So that could be a point against it.  All in all, though, I liked it a lot! The conversations felt very authentic, and it was full of nice little touches (you can see the lives of the other characters, including people who never factor into your and Emily's little drama, progress and change if you read their profiles each year.) It's up to you as the player to interpret whether you or Emily might be being manipulative, or whether you're both just a couple of emotional teens/twentysomethings who are just being your messed up selves.  I entered my own name, and since I'm female it added another little wrinkle to the story that made me enjoy it a lot more, personally.  Anyway, it's free to play and one playthrough takes just a few minutes, so the novelty alone makes it worth a rec in my book.",1,0

You attack things by running into them, you get no additional ways to attack (read: magic), the way you beat the game is by running into things until you're strong enough to run into other things. Taking too much damage from those enemies in the mine? Run into things until you can 1 shot them.

1978009,234080,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition,"If you're expecting or want a metoridvania experience then this isn't it, it's a action/adventure more a kin to God of War than SOTN. It begins quite slow fighting Goblins and lycanthropes reminiscent of Lord of the rings not Castlevania, however around 6-7 hours in the game shifts and becomes darker, you quickly forget the lush forest scenes that you travelled through previously and embrace a more familiar settings a eerie town, a abbey and of course a castle.   Good points  +Music - It's not your typical chip tuney cheese of old castlevania but instead well composed pieces with a lot of depth, not to everyone's taste if your not willing to forego your nostalgia  +Art - The settings are incredible, the graphics are good but it's the art and the art direction that make the game stand out they get the most out of it by locking the camera in place +Combat - Alot of variety and generally really fun switching between differnt 'stances' Neutral, Light and dark and then there's other items that enhance your abilities beyond that +Story - I really enjoyed it, it's dark fairy tale reminiscent of something like the brothers grim. Good doesn't always triumph evil   Bad Points  -Combat - Variety yes, however it could be more tighter, Example Air combat yes you can launch enemies into the air but you quickly realise that being in the air is dangerous with no air block/air dodge you sort of hover in the air for unattended times open to enemy attacks, there is a stomp move that brings you down quicker but really should have taken a page out of bayonetta book here,   -Oh the camera, I understand why they did it (I previously mentioned beautifull scenary) but the camera in combat can get stupid, it fixed so depending on the angle of the player and the enemy there can be times were you get punished cheaply from attacks off screen, not good.  Would I recommend it yes, if you enjoy GoW combat, willing to give it 5-6 hours to get to the good bits (it's fairly lengthy game at around 20-30 hours) and not looking for the next SOTN. I can't wait for the sequel",1,0

4467204,343370,SLAMMED!,"I wanted to refund this game so bad at first, but I realised because I was playing a character I knew wasn't me was central to the experience of pro-wrestling. I'm not an active fan but this made me want to return to my childhood days and enjoy it all.  This game was made by a master of terminology and theory of the genre. I played a heel through almost the whole game and just twice I broke kayfabe, once to sign a fan an autograph [if they said I was a jerk about it haha, I was nice to them.] and also to a woman who had some problem with family or something.  This is a great story and I only played once. It certainly levels with the standard highest bar I place for CoG, which is Choice of Robots [my fave story wise and sheer 'yes you can do that, and it will have a real effect.']. I might not like pro wrestling as much as Robots, I love this game for the same reasons.   I can't quite figure out some stats, maybe they effect wording or story path with no choice involved [except the choices that gave you those stats.] My story path definitely satisfied even if there is only one main path. I felt the sting of every revelation and the confusion of 'Is this kayfabe? Or do I have to kick some ♥♥♥?' I got so into it that in game I started to accidently handicap myself thinking I'd end up having to seriously fight bloody.  If you don't know wrestling terms, the game makes them sorta contextual, but if there isn't an in game dictionary of terms, there is a good free online one.  Good weaving in and out of the timeline to help have you choose things and establish in-game reality. Since at times it'll weave forward or back through time There aren't many, or any, awkward sudden choices to make.  Finally, now and then you get to read a news type blog post about you and what's happening in your corner of wrestling.  Just a lot of fun. Damn good story, you don't just choose how it goes, but like wrestling.... you tune it like a song also",1,0

And in all honesty, I still love this game, but now Overkill has done it. They have lied and introduced microtransactions. The game was getting slightly out of hand with the numerous amounts of dlc, but whatever. I can buy it on sale for cheap. At least it wasn't a microtransaction. Now with Crimefest 2015, where all content was supposed to be FREE, they have introduced CSGO style crates and keys. Weapon skins, but not just cosmetic as the weapon skins can also alter stats.

5646668,449140,Istrolid,"Istrolid is a free single player game about using building blocks to assemble a fleet of ships to beat up an enemy doing the same. Controls can be a bit wonky and it needs better AI for your own ships, or even better formation planning. You can't pause mid combat to my knowlege and a lot of micromanaging is required for fighter fleets leading. This leads to a rather poor experience fighting large swarms of enemies or controling your own. While I had some fun playing around with this game, it dies off fast when the game spontaniously logs you out, claims your email no longer exists when you try to log back in, then triggers your antivirus leading you to delete the game.  Pros:   Decent options for ship building  Good enemy AI  Very good ship display in ship building  Easy to view and master interface     Cons:   Requires giving a 3rd party your email to play  Unable to pause the game in combat to issue orders  Poor controls, mouse only, lack of fleet based orders  Unable to order fleets to stay together when moving  Account issues   ",-1,1
4899537,377160,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is a really difficult game to talk about. Although the box up there is marked 'no,' I don't think this is an explicitly bad game. In fact, there are a lot of really good things here.  To be honest, Bethesda has built a fantastic world, even if it is a bit small. The Commonwealth is packed full of well-designed places to explore, and the interior zones that you can go into generally have some kind of unique story that has happened within them. Terminals and notes will tell you a direct story, but there are indirect things to observe too, like a corpse huddled in a collapsed crawlspace with some candles and a survival kit. The unique dungeons that you'll come across have lots of tiny little stories like this that make for a very immersive experience. Even though the total area size is relatively small, especially when compared to other open world games of the past few years, it is densely packed with places to explore.   Bethesda has also gone ahead and made the gunplay satisfying, frantic, and well-paced. Whereas Fallout 3 and New Vegas had very awkward combat at times, the enemies in Fallout 4 behave in a much better fashion. Ghouls will crawl out from under cars and through windows. Bugs will ambush and surround you. Raiders and other enemies with guns will actually take cover and seemingly work somewhat as a team, rather than throwing themselves at you in a single-file line. They'll even throw grenades, taunt you, and lose track of you. VATs is still pretty overpowered, though, but it is entirely optional to use if you want to avoid being too powerful.  The once hated level-scaling Bethesda is infamous for actually ends up working out really well here. Areas that are too dangerous for you are generally packed full of legendary enemies that are still way ahead of your level, but in general you'll never have quests that are way too easy because you've outlevelled them, and this allows you to tackle the content entirely at your leisure. You can explore freely and do things as you please, rather than feeling pressured to do something because you'll be trivializing it due to levelling too high.  If I stopped here, Fallout sounds like a great game. Hell, it kind of is a great experience, and I easily see myself getting at least twenty or thirty more hours out of it. I'll probably play the DLC at some point, too. I've had a pretty good time exploring the Commonwealth, taking quests here and there, and enjoying the implicit stories scattered across the nuclear wasteland. I will say that if you're the type of gamer who just wants a good solid experience, you really can't go too wrong with Fallout 4. If you've played Bethesda games before, you know what to expect.  And herein lies the problem. Bethesda has walked the line between making casual experiences and deep experiences for awhile. Connotations of these terms aside, a pretty common complaint since Oblivion has been that Bethesda questlines are simple; dialogue is often boring, quests aren't too varied with their goals, and ultimately the game feels kind of empty. However, all of their games seem to have just enough depth to them to keep you engaged for a long time. You can almost always find something new when you boot up a Bethesda game for a new run through it.  But Fallout 4 is different. There aren't really any branching questlines, impactful decisions, or choices to make. There is a distinct lack of variance in the quest goals, and nearly everything boils down to 'Go somewhere, kill a bunch of enemies, maybe pick up an item of some kind, come back.' You cannot talk your way out of combat, there is no alternate stealth route, and the path is clearly laid out for you. Dialogue choices boil down to 'Yes, Sarcastic Yes, More Information please, No, but I'll do it later.' There are exactly four choices, and three of them do the same thing. You can try to alter the path of a quest by being snarky, but it will change nothing. There are tons of wasted opportunities across the wasteland, and you'll come across many interesting setpieces that ultimately are combat zones. Twisted art gallery? Combat zone. Black market arena? Yet another combat zone.  Technologically, the game is a mess. The same bugs that were present ten years ago in Oblivion are still here. NPCs will continue to block doors, end up in strange places, or act in strange ways. I had one escort quest where I entered a new area with the guy I was guarding, and in the new area he appeared hundreds of steps out-of-bounds. I had to solve the quest with noclip. I've had my companion walk into a wall while talking to me. I've ended up with two NPCs talking to each other, but facing different directions. I've had questgivers standing on inaccessible roofs for no good reason. The engine is tied to your FPS, so things can sometimes speed up and down depending on how smooth your game is.  Speaking of performance, my system has been able to max out every single game I've thrown at it (built in December 2015 with top-of-the-line parts), and yet Fallout 4 seems to stutter for no reason in strange places. Fire and certain angles while in dense areas will kill my framerate for no discernable reason, while intense heated gun-battles in busy areas will stay a solid 60fps. I had to spend an hour tinkering with .ini files to get rid of silly problems like mouselag in menus, mouse x/y being different speeds, a claustrophobic FOV for 1080p, and even then not all of my problems are actually fixed. I can hardly believe that this was deemed okay in 2015, and we're three major patches in.  Fallout 4 is a terrible RPG, and a bad Fallout game, but it is a good game. I am unhappy with the fact that this is Fallout 4, but I can't say that I haven't had a good time. While the glaring problems are certainly taking away from my enjoyment of the game, it's a pretty fun light RPG with major FPS elements. If you go in with no expectations and don't expect an iterative improvements over Bethesda's previous games, you'll have a good time.   There isn't a great story here, quests are repetitive, the dialogue is bad, there are no choices, the engine is ancient and needs to be put out to pasture, the settlement system is tacked on with a nightmare-ish UI and is ultimately useless, the inventory is still a nightmare which has been a problem since Fallout 3, the gun customization system appears interesting but kind of sucks in the end, and I could go on and on and on with my complaints. In fact, I'm absolutely certain I would have had a better time just modding the hell out of NV and playing that instead. I spend so much time wishing about what could have been.  Fallout 4 is a huge bucket of wasted potential, but it still has a decent enough core to be enjoyable. It sort of upsets me that Bethesda can get away with releasing games like this, but ultimately I'm another sucker who paid for it and will get a decent amount of hours out of it. Like I said at the beginning, this is a tough game to talk about.",-1,0

But the one limitations is, you can only choose from two colours in Exhibition matches...blue (covering turquoise through purple), and orange (yellow through red). In Season, the cars colours are dictated by the logo you choose. These limits, make it a bit difficult in making an aesthetically pleasing car.

The dialogue is stiff and unnatural, the main character is unlikable, the 'relationships' in this game are far from healthy. As I was able to jokingly compare Mark's relationship with Myra to that of a toxic relationship between two fictional sociopaths in literature. The game would have been funny and worthy of poking fun at for it's sub-par at best artwork, but there is far too much filler and far too few choices that impact the story to make it actually bearable.

Now with the release of 1.0 the game became a little bit more buggy, but if you can look past the bugs the game is a great way to pass the time. There are a few pros and cons and I'm going to list them now. Pros Great community. Mods. Great Multiplayer. The Soundtrack. Worlds. Cons (that I can remember) Some of the missions are bugged. Bugs in general.  This game is just great. If you are looking for a great way to pass time or try to    try to bring back human civilization after earth got destroyed   .

348469,13230,Unreal Tournament 2004,"Fantastic game. Fast-paced, fun, requires skill, accuracy, a bit of thought, quick reflexes, and the ability to actually move around properly.  Dodge, wall-jump, and double-jump mechanics allow you to combine these in any order. They allow you to move quickly and be all over the place, making yourself hard to hit, and allow you to get across the map faster.  There are a multitude of weapons to be picked up off of the map, all of which are unique and have their own special functions, and alternate firing modes.  Hundreds of maps, most with great art-style, environments, geographical design, and music.  Being a game from 2004, the game still looks fantastic (better than many games today, unsurprisingly), and has a multitude of great bonus features.  -Press F11 and the game opens a built-in in-game music player that allows you to play any of your own, or in-game songs, instead of what the current map is playing. -In the audio options, there is a feature that enables built-in text-to-speech for the chat and IRC areas of the game, that way you don't miss a word as your head spins on a swivel, while you are caught up in the fast-paced shooting and battles, with no time to read.  There's a ton of game modes, Deathmatch, Bombing Run, Double Domination, Assault, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Vehicle Capture the Flag, Onslaught, and many others.  Get the game, play against bots (start off on just below masterful, trust me. Just BELOW Masfterful), and have some fun. Instant action and campaign, once you find a decent community, play some online. Do NOT play sniper camping, zark (especially), or ballistic weapons mods exclusively (24/7, or primarily). Also do NOT play DM-Rankin all the time. SUPPORT the servers that don't suck balls and have ACTUAL map rotation!",1,0

2627219,250320,The Wolf Among Us,"The Wolf Among us is the Walking Dead games done right. The Wolf Among us is an enclosed, single-season experience, and so it is given the ability to make its choices truly matter. There is enough similarity that there could be a sequel (and I, for one, certainly wouldn't mind it,) but even so. The story is fantastically well-written, and the characters feel lifelike enough for you to get a real feel of how they will act under certain circumstances (which is necessary to make some of the tougher decisions). If I HAD to have a complaint with the game, it'd be that you can't get every achievement on a single playthrough, and some achievements require that you make rather deplorable decisions. But they're just achievements, who cares?  I can't recommend The Wolf Among Us enough. It is a perfect Noire-themed murder mystery with an ending that leaves you thirsty for more, yet nonetheless thoroughly satisfied.  Score: 9.75/10 Letter Grade: A Dollars per hour off-sale : $24.99/8 hours = $3.12 / hour Dollars per hour on-sale: $6.25/8 hours = $0.78/hour  Verdict: As addicting and exquisite as a good pepperoni pizza.

2518910,246580,The Typing of The Dead: Overkill,"A story so rediculous that it should really be named 'The Typing of the Dead: Overkill or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cheese'. Don't take the rediculously nuanced game which is more or less about a pimp who starts the zombie apocalypse and the secret agent. detective and stripper who set out to stop him.   As for the game itself. It can be both easy and intwensely hard at moments. You will definitely begin to feel your typing speed increase as you play it. Some bits are a bit clunky like the fact you have to completely finish or abandon a word and start over later if you want to switch to a different zombie or, in most cases, a projectile which is just a single letter but makes up 75% of your lost health throughout the whole game. Oddly enough I found the first boss to be one of the hardest in the game. The last boss is just crazy and weird and I didn't really fully unsderstand what was going on. Doing a whole new type of system in a game that basically sets a routine for most other parts of the game is jarring.   6 or 7/10 will play again",1,0

Arkham Asylum pits Batman against some of his greatest foes and acts as the perfect setting for the dark insane tone the batman universe should have. The fighting system in the game is simple but excellent to play with, the amount of bonuses with the riddler challanges give you a reason to continue playing the game, the story doesn't feel too cluttered when it comes to having so many villians, and the voice acting is top notch. My only complaint is the fact that game wasn't exciting throughout. There were dull moments such as saving civilians or getting past Ivy's plants, but that's hardly a complaint when dealing with the entire game.  9.5/10",1,0

4950797,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Long story short, I love this game. I played it all night the day I got it, so I suppose you could say that I was,  Dead by Daylight . Get it? Because I was tired! ... I'm sorry, that deserves a good 1L of bleach. Anyway, the game has yet to become slightly boring. With most games I find, you often find a trend of playing less and less until you get bored. Well, Dead by Daylight and Overwatch have become my favorite two games at the moment with no signs of that changing soon. However, as many have complained about, like Overwatch, DbD is missing some features. To better explain these, let us turn our attention to a list only a great, intelligent, and, most importantly, good-looking walrus can develop.   Pros   -The game has about as much atmosphere as Jupiter. Jupiter is a gas planet. This game has a lot of atmosphere.   -Out of the 3 killers, two of them are balanced. For more information, please check out the cons listed below.   -The survivors are all cool, and even meet SJW standards. 2 males, 2 females. I hate people who believe this matters. This one was a test to see if you were fit for life on this planet.   -Claudette Morel is my favorite character because she comes with a hipster costume. I like to throw myself at the killer.   -The progress system is cool. Get skills and items in a random tree before The Entity consumes them.   -This game rewards teamwork. On my first game I said,'I will let everyone else die, so I can win. I did not win. You best believe that is you don't have 4 survivors until at least 3 of the 5 generators are active, you will not win, unless you are the last one alive and lucky enough to find a trapdoor.   -The game runs nice.   -The system used to escape killers is fun and interesting.   -The system used to kill people and sacrifice them to our lord and savior The Entity is also cool.   -The game has a cool loudout system involving offerings, items, perks, and add-ons to help you get the edge.   -If you do not escape with it, expect to lose your items. Offerings are offered, so you can't use them again until you get another one. This system of disposable items adds a cool mechanic where you can scavenge for items, or use the progression system (The Bloodweb) to earn it. Cool cool in my book.   -The game has a mystery in it, as the bloodweb or origins of th killers are hardly explained. The Entity and the Bloodweb are partially explained by journals as you level up.   -You feel helpless as a survivor. Good.   -You feel insane as a killer. Good.  -This game requires as much skill as is required to cover up a murder well... that was a fun analogy... right?   Cons   -As of now, they have yet to add a party system, but I believe it is planned.    -The wraith is over-powered, because he requires no real skill or practice to use.     -I have trouble getting away from the killer. I know I suck, but can sum1 pls halp :(   -People lobby to jump to try to find thier friends.   -When enough people have jumped and left the lobby, it stops trying to find people for whatever reason.   -I have decent internet. I can play online games flawlessly, with my whole family online. This game must have some kind of connectivity issue, because I will be matchmaking, loading into a match, then go straight back to the loudout screen.    -There is really only one map. There are broken-down buildings with pallets and windows used to get away from a killer. On the farm, they are barns. On the scrapyard, they are autoparts piled high. There are other maps, but that is essentially how the map is set up.   -The killer often just sits around someone he killed, trying to murder anyone who comes to help. It nearly impossible to save them, which can be very frustrating.   -You best have the auditory prowess to hear a mouse bite a cracker from a mile away to play the killer. Or maybe I am just bad at playing the killer. I dunno. It can be difficult.   -I have a good computer, so some intense resolution scaling may be required to allow it to run on the newest PotatOS. I am so proud of that joke. To Conclude: This game is great, but expect some bugs and features that are still absent. Hopefully some balancing will be added. G'day mates.",1,1

The greatest shoot-and-bash experience and comfortable phisics, nice zombies and other monsters, very impressive characters even with this little told about them, pleasant graphics... I like very much almost everything it consists of. Excluding one damn thing - it's singleplayer on expert is too-damn-senselessly hard, mostly due to three stupid AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, which know how to screw up player's best efforts. They could at least obey commands like 'Wait![you three idiots, damn you]', and keep close when they are most needed, that'd do it.

Of course i can look for tricks in internet, but that won't change my negative impressions from this, as of a player with enough experience of killing bots on hardest difficulties(.  My apologies for any inadvertent mistakes in english i could have made. В общем классная игра, вполне подходящая для того чтобы ей надолго увлечься. Боевая часть очень понравилась, как и физика игры в целом, зомбари и прочие уроды тоже радуют, персонажи впечатляющие, хотя о них в игре толком и не рассказывается, общий вид неплохо отрисован. В общем почти все круто. Кроме одного неприятного момента - местами бессмысленной сложности и соответственно низкой проходимости синглплэера на эксперте. В основном из-за трех тупых ботов, периодически критично обгаживающих все усилия игрока. Могли хотя бы подчиняться командам типа 'Ждите[три тупых урода мать вашу!]' и держаться строго рядом когда они больше всего нужны, этого было бы достаточно. Проторчал в игре часов сто, прошел большинство миссий, но ни одной финальной - хотя почти до конца проходил и их(. Можно конечно подсмотреть как это делается в инете, но подпорченности ощущений от прохождения это уже не отменит, мне обычно хватает собственного опыта на максимальной сложности из других игр, чтобы разбираться самому. Чисто боем без трюкачества финалы в сингле л4д на эксперте близки к непроходимым на концах, боты все портят(.",1,0

As I said, the game is pretty linear but maintains an effective illusion of having immense and mysterious environments to explore. Again, it worked for me. I would compare this to some solid, little known sci-fi flick you might find on Netflix that you've never known about before but that you enjoyed. You may not rave to your friends about it, but you were glad that you saw it.",1,0

5892900,50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"The description 'bad or worse choices' may have you thinking you have choices in this game. You do not. It is a heavy handed moralizing storyline that forces you to make bad choices, then punishes you for them.  SPOILER  There is a point in the game where you are forced to use phospherous mortar shells on civilians. It is so stark, I kept trying to figure out what the other 'choice' was. One of your squad actually says 'there's always another way'. No, there really isn't. They position snipers to halt your advance until you use the mortar against overwhelming numbers. If you kill the snipers with gunfire, they get replaced immediately. If you use the phospherous you cannot exit the interface until you have bombed both the enemies and civilians with it - as in target the group of civilians *specifically* and bomb them. 'Choices' were made by their 'creative' team and are not something you find in this game.  As a shooter, it is mediocre. You are effectively in a long tunnel of cover, killing successive waves of bad guys. Your squadmates have unlimited ammo and can only be incapacitated. There are a few near-scripted actions like shooting out windows but the game basically says 'aim at that thing and shoot it', then plays the canned animation sequence.  End note: the developer implied the only way to win was to not play. I disagree. The only way to win is to not buy this game.",-1,0

I had hundreds of hours in this game on 360 and picked it up for a pittance off ♥♥♥. The multiplayer is still going (use the in-game sevrer browser to find clan and community servers). Offical EA servers are still up with x15xp so levelling quicly to unlock all items is an option.  Snipers are annoying on both sides (too many on the attacking team and the game is certainly almost lost for them from the start) and shotguns with magnum ammo are OP, but overall it's a pretty balanced game. Tanks and choppers can wreck your day, but they're easy enough to take out with coordination and know-how. Team play is impoirtant but one player CAN make a big difference by taking an objective, arming an M-COM or just reviving their team mates after an fight.  The Vitenam DLC is also great fun, though it's not as popular as the standard game and servers are few in comparison. I much prefer this to BF4 for multiplayer and recommend anyone give it a try.",1,0

5904810,50620,Darksiders,"Finished Darksiders on Oct. 11th 2014.  This game is fun. You play War, one of the four horsemen … to bring devastation on the world. And, oh my, you do. Hell is loose, the angels and daemons are fighting each other and in the middle is mankind. Well, mankind: not long.  Soon you find yourself tricked and are “accused” to have been showed up at the wrong time, since noone actually has called for you. You are brought before the cosmic council and you are given a second chance to remedy your “failure”. You are sent back to earth to only find out that centuries have passed since you have been trapped. You are weak and lost all your powers (and your horse). Further more, the council decided to attach an enervating spirit to you which watches every step you take. Step by step – level by level – you regain your powers and abilities back (and finally your horse too). You figure out who is behind your imprisonment and manage to take revenge. It’s a road movie in a post-apocalyptic world roamed by daemons and angels alike fighting each other … and you.  The action is pretty cool. You jump, swim, run, crawl, climb, etc. Fighting has some nice moves and as the game goes on you learn new skills and weapons. It really is smooth. The graphics are comic style nice and pretty to watch. The riddles range from easy to pretty awesome. And after learning new skills and abilities you tend to go back to levels you already cleared since you might now discover new places and spots you haven’t been before lacking the ability to fly to these places or even teleport (!). This game has looting features you get hooked on.  War is a cool character. … who is lost in a cool though confusing world.  The setting has some real nice touch. The world is filled with angels and daemons of all kind fighting each other and you’re fighting all of them. Some boss monsters are huge and some are pretty tough. Still one question remains: why I’m doing all this? What’s the point? The “mighty” council is a bundle of idiots easily fooled by a child or they deliberately sent War to prison … for what? Daemons and angels are fighting because … they don’t know what else to do? Yes, the overall action in the game is very addictive but the story could use some improvements. It seemed that some boy child fantasy has gone wild and just stopped at the point when one starts to justify all the action and reaction the characters in the game perform. “It’s there because … it’s just damn cool, isn’t it?”  Finally the controls: I played with my XBox controller on PC. First it starts all nice and easy. Pretty simple and clear. But as you learn new skills, abilities and weapons you find your controller overloaded with zillions of different moves and actions you can do. At the end I felt having about ~40 different key combinations to choose from. And as such I sometimes ended up jumping and flying around before I got the right keystroke to actually hit my foe. This is simply too much.  Still, a very pretty entertaining game.  7/10",1,0
3190179,268500,XCOM 2,"You know that feeling when you are playing Rock, Paper, Scissors and the other player pulls 'gun?' Yeah that's this game, and it makes that VERY clear when you start.  To Returning XCOM players: This game will feel familiar to you, while still giving a variety of new mechanics to play around with. Believe me, it's not just a rehased Enemy Unknown. The difficulty has been ramped up in a variety of ways, including the new Avatar Project timer. Also, timed missions are much more common now, preventing the 'sit back and kill everyone with overwatch' strategy.   To New Players: You will get your ♥♥♥ kicked. Multiple times. Though it can be discouraging to fail a mission or lose your favorite soldier, you can't give up there. That is the enjoyment of the game. It's SUPPOSED to make you unhappy when you lose. Don't be surprised if you lose your first or second playthrough.  Overall, XCOM 2 is a magnificent sequel that, while feeling similar, gives you an entirely different experience, which will be much more prevelant with the new and large modding community. Because of the new mechanics, you will have to try new strategies and adjust to the new gameplay, which is fun in itself. The new emphasis on story can easily grasp you even if you don't realize it. You will not have the same experience in one playthrough that you got from another. An amazing work by the guys at Firaxis.  Good luck, Commander.",1,0

5700856,463270,Ghost 1.0,"Great platforming metroidvania, a throwback to the fun games i played in my younger years. I was a little worried about playing a game like this without a game pad; but i have found the controls using the mouse and keyboard to be better than anything i ever had on an old snes.   The game itself is well written and pokes fun at gaming and sci-fi; making referneces to role playing games and even quoting arnold schwarzenegger. Like most games of this sort the learning curve to how abilities work and why to use them is there for you and often described and shown. Think of all the gameplay you loved in Metroid but not so serious, think of the fun you wish you could have had playing so many games, all that is right here in this game. Music is good, writing is good, gameplay is fun, and the price is right.  I know that I am not too far into the game, but i would suggest picking it up! I got it during the summer sale for half price, but it is fully worth full price. I am also tempted to go back and pick up the other titles by Unepic (i had this one on my wishlist because I watch all the games with the cyberpunk tag).

1802986,230410,Warframe,"Probably one of the wosrt designed games I've ever seen.  Much of the gameplay revolves around grinding and farm, which is fine.  However, getting new gear, and upgrading to better weapons and items with out having somebody help you skip the normal progression.   That 'progression' is a very stunted experience. The game honestly expects you to go through probably over a hundred hours of gameplay with your base frame and limited weapon selection of credit purchasable guns.  There's some decent frames and gear blueprints early on, but some of the components only drop in areas you won't be seeing for a long time, or drop from bosses. Either case results in a lot of painful, dull grind that just isn't fun.  I was lucky to have a friend help me skip this problem, so I got access to a lot of farm I would otherwise not have access too.   Now, gaining access to areas to farm for better gear..sounds easy right? Just do missions and progress nav points.  Except some of the nav points that aren't option to continue progression actually require multiple players, and are often semi-difficult missions. Me, with my twinked gear could do these missions, but virtually every attempt would fail due to allies who are using awful weapons and frame. OR, getting allies worlds above my level and failing my own role in the level due to being so underleveled.  I don't mind that such a mode exists, but making it a mandatory part of normal progression is just stupid.  On top of all that, upgrading your rank (which determines what you're allowed to even attempt building) has a test, and pass or fail, there is a 24 hour cool down on doing another test. So there is actually a hard locked limit on how fast you can progress. Some of the tests are also very specifically geared towards certain frames, meaning failure in some of these tests is relatively easy if you're using one of the mostly awful base frames.  The game by design just encourages blind farming, and goes out of its way to ruin what little fun can be found by having overall bad design choices. On top of all that, this inhuman farm just results in frames so outrageously overpowered it actually removes all skill aspects to the game.   Who wants to farm for almost a thousand hours just to play the game by mashing an AOE attack button that kills 2-3 rooms of enemies?  awful game, I was very shocked at just HOW bad this game actually is.",-1,1

4147036,321560,The Sun and Moon,"So. This game. Is... I would put it in the 'meh' category if Steam had that one, so this is a very light recommendation, but I think its main mechanic is interesting enough and it does enough with it to justify a recommendation, I did have a good bit of fun with this game after all.  That being said, I kinda wish this was a shorter $5 game. Instead of the 160 levels, give us 80 of them, pick out the better ones and give a more consistently enjoyable experience. This game really feels stretched out for content, in the end. There are some levels that toy with a few extra mechanics (time shifting blocks, blocks that pop in and out of existence when you hold the shift button, a few autoscroller-type things, basic stuff mostly) but the majority of the game is confined to making use of the main mechanic in a static environment. And there's only so much that can be done with that, I felt the game getting repetitive pretty early on and it didn't get more varied down the road.  There's also an uneven difficulty curve, I feel. Outside of the bonus world, I didn't find myself challenged too much by any particular world... but each world had a few levels way harder than anything around it. A lot of the boss levels also felt a bit unfair, having to pray that the boss would end up in around the same spot every time so that you could learn the level and complete it, and the final boss especially felt too long. There's a fair few levels requiring precision beyond what the game gives you, too. I feel like focusing on really precise movements in a physics-heavy game may not have been the best of ideas. But that's just me.  The main mechanic of the game is pretty interesting though and makes for some enjoyable platforming challenges. There's some levels about getting enough height via flying through blocks, other levels about trying to get down below via gravity and clever use of the main mechanic, and some just straight-up platformy levels. The extra mechanics occasionally thrown in also make things a bit more interesting; there's a few levels where you basically fly using the user-controlled blocks, and the boss of the 8th world has this very clever proximity thing going on, I really enjoyed that one especially. There's also plenty of replay value here; every level has three time challenges to meet. Personally I couldn't be bothered to even go for time challenges most of the time, ending up with very few sun medals and only a few dozen of the full-moon medals, though usually the half-moon medals aren't too hard to get. I spent around 7-8 hours just playing through all the levels once, so there's no shortage of content here, certainly, though honestly I would have preferred a bit less in the end xD  Overall it's a solid precision platformer, definitely unlike any other game I've played, but I feel the focus should've been on making a more compact and enjoyable experience rather than just throwing every level the developer made into the game and calling it done. I think it would've made this 'okay' a pretty 'great' one if there was a bit more polish to it.",1,0

To do so, you open room after room untill you find the elevator to the next stage. Along your way, you'll have to fight off waves of creatures with your characters or defensive modules, ideally both.  You'll have various ressources to manage, industry to build modules, science to research new modules, food to recruit characters, heal and level-up and dust to light rooms and prevent creatures from spawning there. You can build a team more focused around modules and science or around food and characters. You can mix both.  There is a unique feeling to this game that is hard to describe. Managing your characters and their equipments is fun and the game is hard enough to make you think twice about your strategy. The setting is also very nice, with cool characters and creatures from the Endless universe. There is a lot of jokes and references too but it doesn't feel out of place.  There is an online multiplayer mode in this game but I wouldn't recommand buying it for the multiplayer because I've had a lot of issues while playing with a friend.  It's unlike any other game.

Quick google brought me here:  http://www.pcinvasion.com/no-mans-sky-pc-performance-tweaks-tips  I'm running a 960 and an i5-3570k, and it's not running perfectly, but well enough that it's not detracting from the gameplay.  I'm pretty torn, because its a beautiful game with open exploration, and there are so many ♥♥♥♥ jokes to be had with the animal's procedural generation. On the other hand, I shouldn't expect these kind of performance problems at this kinda price.   Bottom line I guess, is the problems on launch can be dealt with (you shouldn't have to though) and the core gameplay loop will be boring for people that just want an objective to reach. If you like exploring and enjoying a random planet's ecosystem and maybe just cruising through space, I don't think there's another game that matches it out there yet.   I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's an incredible game,   but if you're on the fence at all I'd recommend waiting for a sale. ",1,0
3888269,304650,Sunless Sea,"Sunless Sea is am indie RPG that focuses on discovery, exploration, and choices. Sunless Sea offers a variety of options for the background of the character and for customising the vessel of the player.  The player has a ship and a crew; interacting with your crew can inform you of new places to visit and with some materials the player can improve their stats.  The battle system is severely lacking. You need to outfit the ship with the necessary equipment to enable the ship to fight back. Additionally, fuel is needed to set sail. If the player gets ship wrecked, then it is game over.This is a game that requires the player to read the tutorials and deeply consider the consequences of the chooses the player makes. Mindlessly clicking the all the available options will not help.   The game is very technical and has too many elements to track. Gamers that are used to these types of RPG may want to give Sunless Sea a chance. It is free for the weekend. Otherwise, it is best to wait for this game to go on sale. ",-1,0

It is easy to understand what is going on, the tutorial does a good job for this purpose, and the game mechanics are quite straightforward. However, there are some details which are harder to get from the beginning (like how supplies work, isolated units, attacking a forrest tile etc), which I think give the game some extra depth. Give it time and it will be worth it. The AI seems to do a good job, always did the safest play (however, I haven't played yet the other personality traits).

4590045,352010,Beach Bounce,"In this Vn u will be playing as Tomoyo, U are helping ur grandma run Beach Bounce while she is in the hospital.  Take note that this is a remaster of the game the first time it was released. I only played a little of the original so I can't really compair the two. What I do sort of remember is that in the beginning u have a more back story while waiting at a bus stop to go to Beach Bounce in the original. I have no idea why the remaster would remove this part. In honestly takes away from the story when removing a part like this. I suggest watching a playthrough on Youtube if u want to see part of the original. The original only had two parts out of three released so it's incomplete though.  I really wish we found out more backstory about the characters. I would of loved to learn more about granda Umi.  At least the BG, art of the characters, and the music are very nice. My favorite track is when u are in the games menu. I just love the track:) Also for some reason when ever u would be in Tomoyo's room the room never changes to dark. U have dialouge that u know is night time, but the room is still very sunny LOL. It's to bad a BG wasn't made for a night time transition.  Do watch out because the game does have mispellings here and there. It didn't bother me though as I understood what was being said despite the errors in the spelling.  In all honestly the only two things that really bugged me was that there was no BG night time transition to indicate right away that it's night time. Plus flesh out the characters more.  I would really only get this VN on a sale or better in a bundle. I got this on a bundle. The full price is not worth this VN since the VN could have been even better. Nonetheless I still had an alright time playing the VN:) Also if ur interested there is an 18+ patch if u want the adult content in the VN.",1,0

I was tad hesitant because I didn't want to get disappointed and I'm happy to say - I wasn't. If you loved the first three, you will love this one.   It has the same silliness and humor and crazy puzzles that the first three have, as well as those more serious undertones that can really get you thinking. It made me laugh, it made me cringe (in a good way, the oh-Rufus-you-duffus way) and it made me even tear up.  I'm not sure if I got better or the puzzles were easier but I never got stuck more than a few minutes on a puzzle. Saying that, I didn't feel like the puzzles were stupid or dull, it was the right amount of challenging. A lot of P&amp;C tend to sin in that department (even the previous games of Deponia), creating vague puzzles that end up frustrating more than mentally stimulating, I didn't feel it with this game.  I wholeheartedly recommed this game, if you haven't had the oppertunity to play the other games and you like puzzle P&amp;C please do before playing this one! You won't regret it. Also, it has time travel and time travel is cool so +1 :D",1,1

But, if you put this issues appart since they have been solved, the game is pretty fun. The scenery is beautifull, not as realistic as somme AAA prod we have seen recently, but it's good. The gameplya is pretty easy and enjoyable. So for now, as I play the game since 2 weeks, I would probably recommand it. The leveling is fast, the quest are pretty good (the good guys doesn't seem so good when you follow the story, but the ennemies are even worse). You don't even have to pay if you don't want to, and on the contrary of most F2P MMORPG/MMOFPS this day, it's a really good point. The possibility to fly a little in this world is also a great idea. it gives you the sensation of freedom. And the quest and story aren't linear. So if you wanna try, go on.

As far as I can tell there are 3 different versions of this game, each depending on what ending you got in the first game.   (I got the 'both of them ending' so thats what this review will be based off of.)   I chose the ending i got and trudged on.  Now I was curious to see what they would do with this sequel after the brilliant ending of the first one but in my opinion they chose a pretty good way to base this one off of. The story behind this one is that there's a perculiar girl named Neve (at least thats what I remember.) is at his stargazing spot and they become friends etc.  I wasn't 100% sure how this was going to work out but I had a safe assumption. and it seems my assumption was correct.  The following part spoils the ending if you got the same ending I got in the first game. Read at your own risk.   The game ends the way I expected, choosing which one of the three you liked the most. So you had the three girls and also an option to keep going with the love triangle thing you have going on (did I mention Neve joined that.) Being the reasonable man, I make myself feel like but probably aren't, I saved the game (that'll come clear soon) and chose the 'All of them' option and it was heartwarming to say the least. With the Momoko and &lt;oh derp i forgot her name&gt; endings, they turn out okayish but with the Neve ending, it just feels sad and makes me feel like an absolute dickhed (stfu guidelines)    Done not reading that? Cool. As a sequel, it doesn't live up to the original but I don't think many sequels have. The first one will always be better but as a sequel, its not bad.",1,0

345955,1300,SiN Episodes: Emergence,"Buy it just for the main menu song. The game is slightly worse than Unreal 2, but at least it comes with the original SiN too.  If you want it just for SiN, just buy SiN Gold from  GOG.com  instead. It comes with both SiN and Wages of SiN.  Here's reviews for the entire SiN series anyway:   SiN (1998)   The main game. It did many things that were groundbreaking for its time, but was overshadowed by Half-Life because it launched with tons of bugs that put people off, whom left for Half-Life and never touched SiN again. Even so, SiN's achievements are still unique in the history of FPS because what it did has not been replicated since; not even by Half-Life and its sequels.  Such amazing feats include the much-touted Action-Based Outcomes, where things you do in a level can affect what happens next. Like other old FPS, there's multiple ways to progress through a level, but unlike them, SiN does so in a much more interactive way, such as using computer terminals. You might even find secret sections or levels if you are observant. Other feats include an extremely versatile scripting system that allows things in the game to act in many awesome ways. It ranges from brush manipulation (vehicles, scenery destruction) to enemy tactics. While most games these days are heavily-scripted, none have done the ABO system like SiN did. Also, did I forget to mention this is the first FPS to feature in-engine cutscenes?  Even without these feats, SiN still holds pretty well on its own. SiN features an engaging (if not cheesy) comic book-like character-driven story set in a dystopic city called Freeport where law enforcement is run by private security forces. The most respected one among all; HardCorps; is led by our hardcore and just hero, Colonel John R.(Rusty) Blade; who is assisted by his hacker sidekick, the geeky yet reliable J.C.; and together they must face the menace of evil Elexis Sinclaire, genius biochemist, self-proclaimed Mother Nature, and CEO of the corrupt multinational corporation; SinTek Industries. The story begins in the year 2037, when the highly addictive drug 'U4' (Dyforsanide) is at its peak and it's up to Blade and J.C. to stop Antonio Mancini, who seems to be behind the sudden outbreak of the drug, and find out the source of all the weird happenings around Freeport City lately.  It may not sound like much, but it's certainly more than what Half-Life has to offer (no, having the same plot as Doom but with things that are never explained does not constitute for a deep or good story). Blade is rocking the late 90s FPS hero attitude and his humorous back-and-forth snarks with J.C. keeps the characters interesting.  As for the technical aspects of the game; the graphics is about what you'd expect from a Quake 2 engine game, but it still holds up today and the scripting in the game may surprise you every now and then. The sound design may be a bit shoddy, but the music and voice acting is top-notch and spot-on. The levels are very well-designed; lifelike in the sense that you solve puzzles logically; and allows for endless replayability. The weapons may be standard and the enemies can be difficult at times, but the diverse cast of chatacters and environments will keep you interested until the end.  Overall, I'd give it a 9/10 due to technical shortcomings, but its innovations has certainly secured it a high rank on my list of great games.    Wages of SiN (1999)   Expansion pack of the main game, brought to you by a small team of developers known as 2015, Inc. You may have known them for creating forgettable franchises later on such as Call of Duty, after most of the original team left the company to form Infinity Ward.  Now, onto the actual game itself. Despite being an expansion pack with only 16 levels as opposed to the original's 36, it features a more cohesive experience than the main game. The pacing felt much better, and there was an interesting concept in the game where an action you took in one of the early levels decides the order and gameplay of the next several levels.  Set several weeks after the events of SiN, the expansion pack continues the story with Blade combating the recent increase of mafia-related violence and how it all connects to the rise of the notorious mob boss, Gianni Manero.  The game did not change much from SiN, though it did introduce 7 new weapons and 10 new enemies. The new enemies aren't anything out of the ordinary, but the new weapons are far from the standard FPS-fare like the ones in the main game and are very fun to play with.   Overall, it too gets a 9/10 and shares a seat with the main game.    SiN: The Movie (2000)   This 1-hour OVA is a loose retelling of the events of the original game. Thus it features many discrepancies between it and the game.  Its premise is mostly the same, but the plot develops differently. It's set in 2070, Blade is a cyborg, J.C. is replaced by his sister; Jennifer Armack; and they must stop Elexis from kidnapping a little girl or something.  It's your generic cheap ultra-gory 90s anime with forgettable plot. There's really nothing else to say about it.  It gets a 5/10.    SiN Episodes: Emergence (2006)   The first and only Episode of a planned total of nine. The game is set in 2041. Elexis Sinclaire reemerged from the shadows and with the assistance of the elusive Viktor Radek, her ambitions still hasn't slowed down. After failing to prove the wrongdoings of Elexis and SinTek to the public, Blade returns to combat the threat together with his new sidekick Jessica Cannon, a hot-blooded but skilled rookie officer.  Blade is a silent hero for some reason here. The new sidekick, Jessica, is basically Jennifer from the Movie; bland. As a result of that, we see less of J.C. in Emergence. Elexis is still her same old self. Radek plays the sane man to Elexis' crazy wench, but otherwise he's just an unremarkable lackey. Fun fact: Jessica and Radek are voiced by the actors of Cortana and Sergeant Johnson from Halo, respectively.  Unlike the original SiN, everything it did here is completely outclassed by Half-Life in every single aspect. It's nothing like the original game at all; it instead is a discount Half-Life 2 to be point of running the same engine as HL2 does, and only features 3 weapons and a pitiful cast of enemies. The ABO that was featured in the original SiN is gone. The level design is nothing remarkable and the sound design, apart from the voice acting, is pretty standard and reuses some from HL2 itself.  It does, however, features a Dynamic Difficulty System. The goal of the system is to ensure no player will be stuck in the game or find it too easy. It works by constantly monitoring the player's actions, as well as its own decisions. Instead of altering the enemies health, damage, and speed like other games do, the game changes the difficulty in much more dynamic ways. For example, if the player scores headshots all the time, the next set of enemies you encounter will be equipped with helmets to protect them from headshots. If the player does not take much damage from combat, more enemies will appear and they will start using the weapons' alt-fire. Similarly, if the player is constantly low on health, killed enemies will drop medkits more often. On the other hand, if the player is still low on health all the time after that, the game will try something different to help you. While it sounds good on paper, in the end it doesn't even matter due to how short the game is.  In the end, this game; together with its fellow, 'Half-Life 2: Episodes'; is proof that the episodic format will never work. Sure, you can say it allows the devs to reuse assets in future episodes so they can focus on creating new stuff as well as providing a steady flow of content from beginning till the end, but it's all pointless if they do not have the tenacity, fundings, or workforce to back it up.  Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.",1,0

3698144,294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"To be honest I was not sure if this game was worth buying or not, but I am confident to say it was well worth it. I saw the anime, and found out there was a game of it.  The story so far as I played(I played up to chapter 6), is exactly the same as the anime.  It is a both good and bad thing. If you watched the anime, you know what is going to happen and you are pretty much spoiled. If you havent watched the anime... i think you will find it kind of hard to keep up with the story, because you are not sure which characters are important to the story and which are not, but i think you will enjoy the story over all.  Gameplay, is kind of unique. It is a turn-base strategy game, but things can really change depending on the live input you putin to each action because the enemy will attack you while it is your turn to move characters.  Well, it makes sense, In real battle, the enemy wont just sit there and let you come in to their face and shoot them.  The biggest plus of this game is that you have a some-what control over aiming the guns of your units instead of praying that RNG will roll in your favor. but of course, the farther away from your target, the harder they are to hit, so I always find the need to get really close to my enemies to do significant damage... but that maybe because my units are still low level and my weapons are not that upgraded.  Yes, I did mention levels and weapon upgrades. in this game, you get to train your units and research upgrades for your weapons.  leveling is pretty simple, you gain experience points in battle, you go to the training grounds and spend experience on the class of units you want to level up. Although when I was first told that I have to level up a whole class instead of individual units, i thought the developers were being lazy, but then i noticed the number of units you have at your disposal and the fact that units could die, and be never used again, I came to the conclusion it was the right choice by the devs. Weapons upgrade is similar proccess. You gain development Points in battle and you spend them in the R&amp;D. From what I have seen, it seems like each weapon has loads of upgrades that could be done on them, and you can definitly feel the upgrades getting applied in battle.  What I didn't like about this game was the fact that you pretty much need to grind 2-3 levels to gain enough surviveability in between each chapter... it kinda derails you from focusing on the story, which is pretty enjoyable.   I rate this game 8.5/10(because of the forced grinding, and the fact that i watched the anime before i played the game)",1,0

Positives: -Amazing graphics -Fun maps that put you into a miniature world -Nice optimization and runs smoothly -Good music -Original and interesting game modes -Quickly switch between roles (sniper, assult, defend, objective) just by switching guns (no classes) -Limited ammo and health per life means less camping  Negatives: -Game needs VOIP ASAP!

Recycled guns, recycled enemies, recycled jokes, recycled everything. Which wouldn't mean necessarily a bad thing for somebody who just wants more of the thing he already done many times yet it fails even in that since the writing, level design and whole gameplay lacks anything interesting or fun.

5795474,48700,Mount & Blade: Warband,"Mount &amp; Blade is a truly unique game. It manages to seamlessly blend the strategy, hack-and-slash, and political sim genres into one big sandbox package. Diving into the game for the first time is a daunting task. Outside of a basic tutorial and introductory quest, there is nothing telling you what you need to do next. This lack of direction may put some people off, but it's also what makes M&amp;B so unique. The only main quest and story is what you decide to do. So do you align yourself with one of Calradia's six factions and help them conquer the continent, getting showered with land and titles in the process? Or do you simply play the chessmaster, use your servitude as a way to gain allies, and eventually conquer Calradia yourself? All of this is possible with the game's very deep political system.  The scale of the battles is impressive as well. Larger battles and sieges can easily last a half hour or more, with hundreds of troops all taking part. Combat is also quite deep, with the game taking into account things like your movement speed when calculating damage. Nothing in this game is more satisfying than riding past a group of enemy troops and bowling them all over with a well-timed swipe of your sword.  All in all, while Mount and Blade does have its issues (chief among them are poor troop AI for both friendlies and enemies, as well as rather dated graphics), it is a very addicting game that you can easily sink hundreds of hours into once you get the hang of it.",1,0

Whilst it isn't exactly the most variant game out there (by a long shot most likely), it is certainly a hell of a lot of fun regardless! Just being able to jump in, have 30 minutes, jump out is perfect for me! The gameplay is fast paced and exciting right from the start to the end and it's very easy to jump online or play singleplayer.  The general concept of the game is there are 4 characters in a zombie apocolypse trying to get to safety. Each 'map' is a 'story' in that you run from point A to point B and the last area is a 'defense' area and you have to survive for so long before you get picked up. Pretty basic, but a lot of fun! And playing online means you can play as the zombies which is awesome fun!  Plus with the workshop there's plenty new stuff to try as well from the fans - Some AMAZING work out there (thank you to all of them). So this helps keeps things interesting as well if you need it too - I've personally got skins for all characters/zombie classes simply to update the graphics a bit (but it also makes my game more 'scary' with the skins I have).  The only downside is perhaps the gaming community is crap - And by this I mean, if you're new (or just simply not that great at playing) they will destroy you for it verbally and I apologise for those people (it sickens me when I love a game and this happens). Still, there are some like me who will just have fun - Loosing or winning - And will help where we can to improve your game.

4724712,363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I loved the table top game and was hoping to have a multiplayer game that simulated it.  Stylistically the ship models and general feel are spot on. However, the gameplay mechanics are… odd.  Just to frame this, an imperial cruiser is around 5 kilometres (3 miles) long and has a mass of almost 30 megatonnes (around the mass of 100 empire state buildings). These things are colossal behemoths of architectural magnificence in space. They are lumbering giants that bring entire star systems to their knees.  In the game they bounce off of each other like ping pong balls.  These ships are many kilometres long, but every ship in the game can burn retros and flip end on end in seconds. While I could possibly understand that with Eldar with their incredibly agile high-tech ships, watching a massive imperial ship do similar makes me wonder at the crew being splattered against the interior walls from the G-forces this would involve. As a consequence of these immersion breaking dynamics, a lot of the multiplayer games I’ve played come down to ramming and bouncing ships out of the way at a speed that seems completely at odds with the scale being represented.  In my mind the speed of the ships needs to be drastically reduced and ramming impacts need to be much more… impactful.  The crazy dynamics aside, and without making reference to the oodles of bugs I have encountered so far (full release my rear) my other real issue in-game is the complete disregard for squad support. More than a handful of ships in your fleet and micro becomes a real pain in the posterior, even with the ‘tactical cogitator’ which allows you to slow down time to make orders more easily. Micro is NOT helped by the fact that my three identical Cobra’s can’t fly in formation, nor can they all launch torpedoes at the same time. Want to put the torpedo firing on auto to try to mitigate this? “Scr*w you,” says the game “I’m just going to launch these suckers when I feel like it then”.  However, these frustrations pale in comparison to my biggest bugbear in the game – the multiplayer matching system. You get NO say over how many points you want to play, what game type you want to play, nothing. I want to practice a bit in some nice small 300 point cruiser clash games where I can micro comfortably and learn the strengths and weaknesses of my new ships, learn tactics and explore the game properly against live opponents. I cannot do this when I am placed in a 600 point protect the convoy mission where I have only one light cruiser due to mounting casualties and the opponent can just full ahead through the ping pong escorts I lay in his path in a vain attempt to shield my transports.  I really hope that these issues are resolved over the coming weeks, as I really want a BG game that I can love, but I am disappointed that it has been fully released in the state it is currently in. I was the first of my group of BG loving friends to buy the game and will have to advise them not to get it until the game reflects better the game we know and love rather than a game of destruction derby in space.",-1,0

Zer0 (the assassin) was my first character and even though he is the toughest to master i loved my experience. i always thought Borderlands was meh, but as you can see i am coing up to 500 hours played so not too bad as all. multiplayer is full of friendly people :O shocking i know, they're only too willing to help/join you in game if you become stuck. this is fantastic. i can recommend this game.",1,0

3318490,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Simply put, this is one of the best games I’ve ever played and I started back in the days of the old Sega Master System 2. It is not your standard FPS game and I think that is what catches many people out. Forget all the rubbish people spouted about DLC and the initial release marketing as this actually has zero impact on the game itself. All DLC is either cosmetic in nature (skins) or simply added content that plays within the same world as you. Far from hindering your experience or making it easier for one side or another, the only impact it has is add more variety of opponents and teammates, and that is only a good thing. Nothing is required to be bought other than the base game.  If you are not sure what to believe after reading things online, I can understand. The fact is that this game has a surprisingly steep learning curve and not everyone was ready for it when they made their first gameplay impressions. It has a lot more subtlety and nuance than you might think but it takes time to work these things out. It’s not a game you can jump in, guns blazing, expecting an easy win. You really need to learn the strategy, but when you do, it can be an awesome experience.   Some things to remember are that the old lone wolf style of play just doesn’t work here unless you are keen to give the Monster a go. It is imperative as a Hunter to work as a team as the characters and classes are all very good at what they do, but cannot win the day by themselves. If you learn the roles each class needs to fill and support your teammates while they do their jobs then you’ll really enjoy yourself here. Definitely a game for people that enjoy teamwork.  I love real time strategy games like the Total War and Command &amp; Conquer series. This game incorporates some of the strategy of these types of games and puts it into a first person shooter scenario. It’s hard to explain but if you can think strategy as well as point and shoot, then this game is perfect for you. Give it a go, try the different classes, see what you think and figure out what class gels with you the most.  At the end of the day, you need to make your own opinion. I can tell that it’s built by a developer that actually listens and actively involves its community. It continues to grow the content and add value at every turn, most of which is for free. Ignore the negative hype, and if you’re not sure then simply jump on the Turtle Rock Forums  (https://www.turtlerockstudios.com/)  and I'm sure you’ll figure it out for yourself. It is a great game to play, the community is open and passionate, and if you’re willing to put a bit of effort in to learning how to play your chosen role properly, then you will have a fantastic time. This game is definitely worth it. ",1,0

4176179,322330,Don't Starve Together,"I have only briefly played Don't Starve and from my experiences with that game, I must conclude the game is extremely difficult, however Don't Starve Together, takes this already difficult game and makes it a little more easier, by having compansions to help you along the way, as well as also add another layer of difficulty at the sametime. It adds features unique to itself while also keeping to the same formula as the original game.  The style of the game is visually beautiful and has a very Tim Burtonesque feel to it, which if you enjoy alternative styles or even those movies, you'll really be able to appreciate the visuals of this game. As well as that it's soundtrack is unique in the respect the music of it is primarily swing and oldies. Things such as the shadows and creepy atmophere can get very tense and eerie, so it's definitely much more fun to play with others. Allowing yourself to both share in the difficulty and creepy nature of the game.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone, who has little experience with survival games or even experienced players, it's a refreshing take on the genre and definitely keeps you glued to the game play for hours on end discovering new things about game, enjoying updated content and allowing you to face new difficulties each time with the randomly generated worlds.",1,0

I finished the game in 1 and a half hour. Graphics are outstanding.  While the graphics are outstanding I can't say the same for the in-game mechanics. Don't get me wrong. They are smooth as hell, but they don't give you the freedom you payed for ;) EX.: You can't crouch. Neither jump. Just run ,push and climb.  Another flaw of the game is that if you stay were you are and the entity is behind you can stay there and she/he will be gone. So there's no point if she/he follows and then he/she goes away because you didn't turn around.   Apart from that the overall game is interesting. I bought it when it was 9.99 bucks so it worth it.

2493498,245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"Skullgirls is a great game, Each character has a unique playstyle that caters to different people. Everyone I have seen that has played this game has ended up finding atleast 1 character who plays exactly how they want.  Fights in skullgirls are great, you want to usally create large combos, Like most other fighters, However there are a few twists to this. You may play with either 1, 2, or 3 characters, its like marvel vs. capcom style where you may switch between characters and call in for assists. The more unique part of Skullgirls is the ability to cancel an opponents combo if it is going to be an infinite combo. This makes sure that infinite combos in the game are stopped, which makes fights much more tense as it is not about who gets the first hit in wins.  Skullgirls is a easy game to learn, but a hard game to get good at. I have never been amazing at fighting games, The only one I am actually really good at is Persona 4 Arena. However I was able to quickly learn a few combos and how to play Skullgirls.  If your looking for a good fighting game that is not expensive and that has balanced fights, I greatly suggest Skullgirls.",1,0

6214642,67370,The Darkness II,"Linear action FPS game with a lot of violence, blood and vulgarity. Basically it's like playing a horror game but   YOU ARE THE HORROR!    What I love most about this game is the story-telling, the narrative of the game. All the characters in this game have their own personality, even the crazy ones! The person who voiced Johnny Powell is a genius!  There is a multiplayer mode called the 'Vandette'. It has a number of co-op missions that you can play solo or play with up to 4 players online. Each playable characters have their own personality and their own dialogues as well! The multiplayer campaign fills in the holes in the single player story very well.  This is one of the rarer games where the multiplayer mode actually adds value to the single player story-telling.   The artsy graphics adds a lot of nostalgic feel to the game environment. This type of graphics rendering method also brilliantly mask away a lot of disgust from the bloody violence where it would be gross if rendered too realistically.  If you are the reading type and like to understand as much of the game world as possible, you can learn a lot from reading the relics origin. The game universe is based a lot closely to our real world religions, with a little fictional element added into it. And it makes a lot of sense! (On top of that, it has the funny narration from the crazy genius!)   It has moderate replay value.  Once you are done with the single player campaign, you can replay the campaign with new game plus to learn more about the game setting and to hunt for collectibles. But it's only worth 2-3 playthrus before it gets repetitive. Multiplayer have quite a number of maps but since multiplayer characters have very limited skillset, it gets repetitive very soon.   All the achievements are quite doable in single player, 100% completion is not difficult.   My Score: 10/10 (Highly recommended!)",1,1

5826471,49520,Borderlands 2,"I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have fun. You can hang out with your friends and kill raid bosses or play the campaign, or you can join random people and just have fun doing whatever they are doing. All in all the shoot and looting in this game is really good, however, some legendaries don't drop often enough to make it worth farming for. However, when you finally do kill that boss you have been struggling to kill or finally get the legendary you've been wanting, it feels really good. It makes you feel like you actually earned what you got.  Secondly, the story is absolutely amazing even though at some times it feels a bit repetive, for instance 'Kill this thing and pick up what it drops.' This happens a couple times in the story and in the side missions. All in all, I really recommend this to anyone who likes fun first person shooters with a lot of humor at some times. Each character feels unique and different from the others, whether its a playable character or just an Npc. Honestly I think you will have a good time playing and my final rating for this game is a 9.5/10.  ",1,0

I've yet to get into the scripting and complex/back end stuff, but the upfront storyline, characters, dialogue, locations and so forth are fairly quicker to learn to do and once you get started, it becomes much easier and faster to move along.

1539922,22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Have you ever wanted to live a life that is more fascinating than your own life maybe? Well climb aboard this magic whirling dervish of delight, kitten whiskers, and be prepared for a treat. In this newborn hell you arrive in the mysterious colony of blue jumpsuits, searching for a true meaning that never could be retrieved. In search of this meaning you will wander across the chocolate chip wasteland in search of foes to murder. This game teaches you the power of economics in that with each new murder you commit you become a wealthier and more likeable chap. Sometimes people run up and tuck a little hostess twinkie roll right into your breast pocket, maybe they give you a little smooch too just to show you they take you seriously. If they give you a smooch though it's always a classy anime smooch, no tongue, just straight forward and business-like. Then as soon as the breathtaking emotion of smooching a dirty stranger begins you find yourself alone again in a city shaped like a bowl of crunchberries. You wander dazed and bewildered through the broken hovels in search of your love divine but they are gone like the ashes of your dreams. Disenchanted and broken of will you venture back out into the chocolate chip-lands in search of that meaningful encounter you once knew. Maybe the horned monster beasts of the ancient cities know of love, perhaps they will whisper it into your nostrils as they dance the forbidden dance we all know too well. Only the space lords know the true nature of your destiny and they have been silent for years; maybe that's for the best though. So onward you press into the delicious wasteland in search of the true meaning of lucha and the ever elusive lootie loot gained from gentlemanly combat or grenade gifting. At times you find yourself wondering what this is all for, what the end climax to this terrestrial misery will be, but then you see the cackling face of your dear papa and it all comes back to you.   I give this game a Granola/3. I'd play it for more than one hundred minutes.",1,0

If this is the case and you have the opportuity to grab this game at a nice discount (holiday sale) then you should debate no longer and pick this up.  The humor as it plays along side with the 80s nostalgia is the focal point of this game. The music, dialogue, voice acting, cut scenes and even the tutorial had me laughing from the beginning. The game is a bit short in terms of its main story. I tend to poke around in games completying side missions along the way and even so I managed to finish the game in less than 10 hours. I still have a LOT more content to work through so I in no way feel I was cheated out of material.  The gameplay is standard FPS fare and it's more than fine for this experience. There are some details to cherish (you can throw a D20 to distract enemies, for example) and they play nicely. You get to rip out the hearts of your cybernetic enemies and use them to distract mutant dragons which roam the gameworld. Yes, the dragons are killable. Yes, you can kite the dragons to kill your enemies.   Trust me, you'll love this.",1,0
192088,107410,Arma 3,"I passed quite some time with the current ArmA title, as I did with the successor of OFP, the original ArmA and ArmA II.  I can clearly see a road of improvement here, although some major hick-ups of the series haven't been fixed yet.  in short terms:  Pros: +provides a giant and incredibly interesting military Sandbox  +very powerful, altough not easy to handle editor tool +basic training scenarios to slowly guide you off the CoD and on the BI route +very mod friendly (+...and thousands of epic mods, one of the most active and best modding cons out there. Not really a ArmA III feature, though) +wide range of multiplayer modes. From CoD style battles to semi-realistic tactical fights. +Very impressive graphics and a immersive sound engine +tons of weapons and vehicles +submarine environment, diving (whoever does that...I don't) +constant improvement of the engine +fair DLC/pricing policy that offer a wide range of improvments as free updates (see Helicopter DLC) +interesting gun play, Marksmen DLC to come. +satisfying vehicles, flying helos is fun and will be even more with the coming DLC   Cons:  -bad MP code, though it's slightly getting better -bad server browser -engine hick-ups -UI (unmodded)...hey, it's ArmA! Remember ArmA II UI? ...urgh, right, I CAN see improvement here! -eats PC power like nothing. NASA pc recommended for Ultra settings and high FPS. (in Intel/NVidia terms: playable with &gt;i52500k/&gt;760line. Sorry I'm not a AMD user.) -rather boring and baldy balanced campaign, but can still bwe fun to play in some ...cases.  I'm running ArmA III on an aged i5 2500k stock/ 770ti. And I'm pretty content with it's performance. It's absolutely playable but you won't see 10km far while getting 60 FPS out of the box.  Performance still is a major issue. But remember the level of detail and view range you get in ArmA are still amazing.  Arma has a steep learning curve fo newcomers, but it's very rewarding when you reach the top. Tutorials (look out for Dsylecxi's YouTube channel, too) may help you on the way up. Feel free to play around in the edito, too. No need to crash helos in MP battles :D  Remember it's neither a hardcore sim, nor a shooter. It sits somewhere in the middle, pretty comfortable at that.  Some small things I don't like, but thats my personal flavour: -scenario (Greek islands are so barren...I miss Chernarus.) -futuristic materiel and time-line (Wheres my AK? And...Iranians? In Greece? 300? Aww, come on BI...bad choice.)  Overall: If you got a potent machine and the will to find work-arounds for some technical issues that plagued BI games since the beginning it's a must have. No arguing here.  Since early alpha I sank many an hour into this game and it's still engaging, while I see the title is being constanlty improved by the devs.  I can give a solid recommendation.",1,0

687116,206420,Saints Row IV,"This morning I watched Rogue One, the new Star Wars movie.  This evening I finished the main story for Saints Row 4.  Star Wars is cool and all. But why bother with regular Star Wars when you can have Star Wars with gangs and superpowers, with the US President as protagonist and Johnny ♥♥♥♥ing Gat as ancillary?  Because that's what the Saints Row 4 campaign feels like - an epic sci-fi movie, a wacky comedy, and Grand Theft Auto all rolled into one. It never quite feels too easy, but it's not particularly difficult. The charm is in feeling like a badass.  It's rare that video games can fully capture the choreographed action scenes of movies, all those precise moves and dramatic sequences one after another. But Saints Row manages it. It's like fifteen hours of the coolest, most adrenaline-filled action scenes, with none of the boring filler that you have to sit through when watching a movie. And when it's all over, you can casually have sex with whomever you want, while cheesy Sex Music™ plays in the background.  It is true that the sandbox gameplay here is lacking. The map is small and is recycled from the third game. The collectibles are tedious. The 20fps cutscene lock is weird. But I never play Saints Row games for their sandbox gameplay. Once I finish the side missions, I'll probably mess around for an hour or two and then uninstall. Until I play it again, of course.  I already forget most of the plot from Rogue One.",1,0

Yes the visuals are great (though some of the effects break the immersion, especially the plastic-looking black goo that appears in places). It has a great deal of potential, but it just was not well executed. Maybe I have been spoiled by games like Amnesia and Outlast, but the horror elements didn't affect me and it became more of a task to finish than an immersive experience. Half of the problem is the poor control and interaction system. You have to be in very precise locations and at specific angles to interact with the objects, which becomes even more frustrating when you have to open doors through holding a button and rotating/moving. This often became extremely frustrating, since much of the game is just opening doors or drawers.   If they worked out a better control system and fleshed out the game a bit more, it certainly would be a game to pick up, but right now I cannot recommend it at full or even half price.",-1,1
5210377,39670,Chaser," Let me set the scene for you.   It's 2004 and I had a factory built desktop from Dell ($500 then). It was in no way built for gaming, but I was determined to play on it anyway.  I browsed the net for games to play for free, and I found a multiplayer demo of Chaser. I downloaded it, waited several hours for it to load, and installed it.  For being the first ever fullscreen multiplayer FPS I have ever played, this game was incredible. It was like Call of Duty to me as with kids today. I played every. Single. Day. From what I remember the multiplayer being like, it was fast paced, VERY strategic, had amazing level design, and a wonderful array of weapons to choose from. Every time I see a FAMAS-designed rifle in any other game, I am instantly reminded of Chaser.  This game even taught me how to type at 80/wpm . I still often set my keybinds in other games according to Chaser's default keymapping.  Now, I know you're probably thinking, 'Well this is a review from memories of a 9 year old kid. Of course it's going to be over-exaggerated.' Well, it's true this is the first ever actual game I played on a PC. And it's true I had really no knowledge of what kind of game mechanics are good or desired. I never even touched the campaign because it was a multiplayer demo. But, if I could have compared the multiplayer in Chaser to anything today, it's very close to Counter Strike and Halo: CE. There's no extra crap. It's just you, some guns, some grenades, and an gritty and intelligent level design. It's simple, awesome, fast, and intense.  I love this game to death and I wish I could still play on multiplayer. If there are any graphic/multiplayer mods available for this game, PLEASE let me know.  Edit: I FOUND THE MULTIPLAYER PORTAL :D        Multiplayer&nbsp;",1,0
4104920,317720,Tiestru,"I really want to thumbs up this game but the downs outweigh the good  The good: - Its a refreshing TD game, i love the style which is why i persisted with it for so long  The Bad: - Never hit the restart button, not from the main menu, not from the escape menu. No matter what level you were on, this puts you back on to level 1 and you have to redo the tutorial! - When doing the tutorial, make sure you follow the instructions precisely, you can get stuck if you put the lightning node on the wrong spot and you don't have enough money to put another one. It does lock you from selling though ... - Mobs sometimes get stuck, at first I thought it was normal, giving you breather, but alas it looks like its a bug.

3643544,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is hands down the best open world RPG to date and is a benchmark that all next gen games should be compared to. The developers had very few creative boundaries when creating the game and the depth this adds to the story really shows in a way that very few games ever have. The entire world is handcrafted, an initial play through can take between 60-100 hours and I was captivated for its entirety. Play it with a gamepad, the keyboard controls aren't intuitive.  Though similar, every single quest feels unique. Your choices matter a lot. It's so satisfying to see this trilogy wrapped up with mass effect. ;^) The combat is always satisfying and the atmosphere is perfect. There is a huge cast of voice actors in this world that allow the world to feel truly diverse as you travel between its different regions, the quality of voice acting is even better than in Dark Souls.  The game has a few short comings but they are greatly overshadowed. The movesets of enemies are fairly limited, this varies greatly but is a trade of for a huge supply of monsters and quests. The foremost issue is that the world doesn't scale with character level. This is a good choice in the short term but when endgame rolls around there's practically nothing that is remotely strong enough to be challenging.  There are also a lot of potentially quest-breaking bugs. Just be sure to save often and it wont be more than an occasional nuisance, there are bound to be bug fixes in the coming months, CDPR has promised to support the game for a full two years before moving onto cyberpunk 2077.",1,0

Basically, I'm not quite a fan of any extreme sports games, well I am, but I don't play them too much. My last game was Gravity Defied I guess .-. So, this game pretty much delivers. I didn't expect it to be any good, but that game just dropped my expectations to tha ground. First of all, graphics is pretty decent. I did enjoy all these dystopian pictures that the developers showed in the game, classically, about the police, fire everywhere and some kind of nuclear war o3o, especially in the last part The gameplay itself is pretty nicely done, physics is decent, and it's quite easy to play, since you need only 4 keys and within an hour you're gonna be pro at this game, of course of you aren't a lobster. Challenge in this game is pretty fun, getting points, and stuff. The easiest way to win is for sure time challenge, that I've won several times there lel. It's not too much of popular games these days so you do have a chance to get on top of board even not being pro at extreme sports games. The Challenge Mode isn't really too interesting...worth playing once or twice though. But I'll be sure to play story mode again and again to get mroe stars and earn more records  So, all in all, this is not yet perfect game, but rather decent, sometimes it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and you just don't understand how to do some sh*t at some points, but it really delivers, so 8.8/10  Recommended for fans.",1,0

585441,204100,Max Payne 3,"A must play for any Max Payne fan, the third installment of the game series takes some uncertain steps while out of the hands of its original developers, but Rockstar does the gritty noir shooter justice.  The single player is where the majority of the fun is to be found. A highly polished and artistic story of redemption ties together the game's fantastic gunfights, which are more destructive and elegant than the previous two games. There is also an increase in tactics, although a skilled player can still run and gun through the levels with ease. After playing through the story, the game also features an arcade mode, and competing to unlock high scores gives the game a great replayability.  The less said about the multiplayer, the better. It's a joke, a stain on the game, sparsly populated, awkward, confusing, and it does not do the game's mechanics justice, as those mechanics are best used for mowing down enemies en-masse, not for player-to-player combat.  The good news though, is that you will easily get your money's worth with the single player alone. If you're on the fence, allow me to push you off; buy this game. Now.",1,0

3859863,303870,Blinding Dark,"Blinding Dark game is one of few horrors where you are constantly horrified to make another step forward. Its music and timing of beings you encounter will never get you relaxed and enjoy the view, because you will continue being scared until you finish the game. It’s quite realistic in terms of staying alive, where with just few hits you will find yourself near the death state. And after being killed you will respawn at a certain place with penalty of losing some part from your total mana points. The story keeps you involved even if its look like there is not much of it, you are provided with a voiced journal of the man you are playing with as he travels along, which are rich in information of what’s really going on around you. Gameplay usually consist of a certain area where you need to solve puzzles in order to open a path ahead. There is a rich variation of weapons u can use, where each weapon are designed to defeat a certain enemy, so you have to be prepared. Know the enemy weakness and select the weapon accordingly. I really enjoyed this horror game. If you really want to remind yourself of being afraid then this is a game you need to play.",1,1

This is what makes a game good. Good games are Difficult and Challenging. Good games don't hold your hand. Good games don't let you win right away. Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is a good game because it presents you with challenges and obstacles you must overcome.

2234447,239820,Game Dev Tycoon,"The game is a lot of fun, I admit this. At first it is even amazing. But then it starts to LAGGGGG. I honestly have no idea why, but it lags like hell. My FPS fell to like 1 per second if not less at times. All other games I have are running smoothly on my setup which includes Bioshock Infinite which must be a much heavier game but this title is so laggy that it is painful to play. I don't know if it is a common problem, I just say what is my problem. Then there is a matter of controls. They are buggy and slow. And you need to task your devs one by one by clicking on them. There were a lot of instances I found the controls lacking. The scoring system is a bit strange too. But I guess that can be called a feature. Anyway, the idea is exellent. The realisation is poor. If there will ever be a patch that will fix this lag I will gladly change the review for positive.",-1,0
3194050,268500,XCOM 2,"Just finished the game after around 100 hours. The feeling is pretty mixed. But first thing first, XCOM 2 is definitely one of the few games I ever enjoy since Fallout2 and Neverwinter Nights. It has every better feature that a turn-based game can offer:  + Friendly and well illustrated interface with pop-up information  + Various soldier classes with distinguishable skills  + Various types of armour, ammo and enhancement component available  + Relatively free environment to develop your base and squad  + Complicated and yet rich and colourful game play  Based on the original game structure, XCOM 2 introduces a new feature of ammo/armour type and enhancement components concept. With right combination of these items, you can customize different gears for each class of soldier to boost their skills. Together with newly designed class skill set, it makes the game play very rich and full of options.   The alien enemy units are well designed, too. Unlike those just-shoot-with-different-weapon types in XCOM, not only there are more classes of unit, but also they now possess own distinguishable skills. Many of them are quite powerful and dangerous. Thus combat now becomes very dynamic and challenging. Careful considerations and calculations are required all the time. From squad configuration to target priority and combat sequence, you’ll need to squeeze every single point of output that your squad can manage in order to survive. Again, it makes the game play very rich and full of options.  As for the downside of the game, there are quite a few as well. Such as: - System requirements are little bit high.  My 2 years old rig (i5/8G/GTX760/SSD) can just manage medium graphic setting. And still lags sometimes. Considering XCOM can be played on GPU integrated Haswell, that’s quite a leap. - Several bugs. Such as enemy lancer can sometimes perform 4 actions instead of 2 during a turn, game freezes during reload or mission debriefing. - Story driven and forced. In XCOM, player can control the main story progress and enjoy the game at leisure. Now in XCOM 2, time is limited. Everything has to be rushed foward to avoid total failure. Personally I don't like such setting, it puts player under hgh tension and spoils the fun to replay. - The last and the most: the Evil Lord RNG … Your shots miss a lot but enemy's don't, not mentioning that 95%-and-still-miss. More, it seems the game doesn't refresh the random numbrer queue when you reload a saved file. I intentionally tried ‘hack-quick load-hack’ for 10 times, and the results were almost the same. Only after fully quit to desktop and restart the game could I get an obvious different result. I wish the RNG should be more reasonable and balanced in the future patch.  Besides of these issues, I see many people complain about the frame problem. Well, to my opinion, those people probably own top rigs already and they still want to play a turn-based game like CoD. As if to kill an enemy at 120 fps is easier than at 30 fps. For me, as long as my modest PC can run smoothly under medium graphic setting, I’m happy.   Coz the game is excellent enough.",1,0

With a campaign underway to destroy the tribes of norsca, the Old World was entering an unprecedented age of peace for Man and Dwarf.  But, with no external enemies to fight, the free peoples of the Old World began to turn upon each other. The southern kingdom of Estalia declared war on the dwarfen kingdom of Karaz-a-Karak. Both sides called upon the Empire to aid them as they were bound through alliances – but the Emperor saw no point to the trifling quarrel and refused to back either side. Neither side took this well but the Dwarfs, who hold grudges for centuries, were outraged at the Empire for breaking their oaths and not long after declared war upon them. The Emperor immediately sought to resolve things diplomatically but alas to no avail, and now while the Emperor's armies are away in the north and Elector Count Alberich Haupt-Anderssen trapped in the besieged castle of Drakenhof, the people of the Empire must ready themselves to face the wrath of High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer.

2907116,254700,Resident Evil 4,"A long and challenging game that provides a lot of action. Although it is an action game sooner than a horror one, it is the calculated kind of action game. You have to think through what you're doing, and luckily the professional difficulty is only unlocked when you pass the game at least once on normal difficulty so you will already know what you will be facing and what you're supposed to be before you choose a dificulty that's actually very challenging.   To play this game you need  skill and a lot of patience , as well as quick reflexes. The QTEs can sometimes be pretty annoying.  The game still has some bugs, but updates are constantly being released and there is even a public beta that gives you the newest patches before they are officially released, and the game looks a lot better than the original.  There is a lot of content in this game. It starts out slow, you will probably be wondering how this is a Resident Evil game, but trust me when I say that it gets a lot better later. The enemies you face are completely different later on and the bosses are unique and offer great boss battle experiences.  There are a lot of treasures and secrets in each level, and by the time you finish the game you will most likely want to play through it again! The game offers huge replayability! When you finish the game you get a cleared save, which lets you start a new game with the same difficulty as the cleared save's difficulty with your entire inventory from the end of the game, and you even unlock new things you can buy in shops by completing the main game as well as the DLCs. It's also important to note you unlock new costumes, not just for Leon but for other characters as well, and you can choose which to use when you start the game.   The downside  for modern gamers is that it's not a fast-paced kind of shooter. It requires a lot of concentration and sheer willpower to beat some levels and if you never played classic hardcore games before you will probably not like this one either. The aiming feels awkward, your enemies come in large numbers and deal a lot more damage than you do, so you will have to skirmish and play safe a lot in this game. The graphics, although greatly improved when compared to the original, still have that classic look and if you're used to playing games like Crysis or the new Call od Duty games or similar, you will probably not like this game's graphics. It's an excellent game, but you have to have a certain appreciation for old-school titles.  It is a difficult game. Maybe not Dark Souls difficulty, but by the time you face some of the end-game enemies, you will probably be praising the Sun with each victory.  To sum up, a must-have for fans of classic games and the Resident Evil franchise!",1,0

4104418,317620,Space Hulk Ascension,"Much improved over the previous title, which I quite enjoyed irrespective of some of the reviews. This time round there are far superior visuals, game looks very good on 4k res I must say.  There are also some nice changes to the mechanics of the game; such as RPG style leveling, making the permadeath of your more veteran squad members &amp; unlocked perks tough to take on higher difficulties. I was also glad to see a change to the 'weapon jammed' issue from the first game, god that was annoying, in this version the weapons overheat instead (you can spend action points to cool/unjam in a more controlled way), which I feel has brought a more balanced feel &amp; thankfully less of the FFS inducing randomness of the last version. Certainly worth getting still if you have the previous game, theres more than enough difference in content &amp; a reasonable shout at re-playability with the different legions &amp; DLC  *Play on the higher difficulty levels to get the most out of this game   Overall  + Looks great  + RPG style character leveling, unlocks &amp; customisation are a nice touch  + New mechancis balance play issues from previous title  + Rename the marines as your mates &amp; see who survives!  - Missions can get a little repetitive  8/10     ",1,0

Love the size of the system, love the campaign mode, love the visuals... combat is great fun and the addition of expendable modules is really clever.   The Fleet isn't that well expanded on, I don't quite understand how best to use them or how to upgrade them.  The way you access menus is fantastically intuitive, I didn't need a tutorial (which come thick and fast without any real sense of being anchored to what you're doing in-game) to reload weapons or move cargo, the buttons were just... where they should be.  EDIT: Three hours in and still loving it. Worked out a few more of the game mechanics (loving the tactical overlay which you have to manually map, I have it on left-shift) and realised that I don't have a fleet yet! The RPG-lite elements are great, incremental improvements on all sorts of things means you have to really put some thought into what gameplay you want to get involved in. At this stage, unsure if it was wise to go with campaign mode, I think this could be even better in pure sandbox.",1,0

2260265,24010,Train Simulator,"Today i am writing a brand new review of train simulator 2016 by dovetail games for steam (which i might have to do in stages) as i am very very concerned about the purchasing of new locos and scenarios. Ok here we go what i have found is that dovetail will release new locos and new scenarios although usually not at the same time what i have found and experienced is that when you buy a loco that as been released some time along the way they will release a new scenario that will contain the loco that you have bought now a few people have mentioned this to me and ive not seen anybody comment about this. when you buy a new scenario that is priced quite high to begin with at £24.99 (i dont know what that is in $ or euros) and it as the loco in that you bought seperately way before the new scenario comes out you go to the check out and you get a message stating that you own one or more assets and therefore you wont get them again in this pack and you know its the loco you just recently bought you still have to pay the full £24.99 which is very very unfair of dovetail to charge this,(for example)if you pay £12.99 for a loco and then you go and buy the new scenario at £24.99 (baring in mind the loco was released first)what dovetail/steam should be doing is one of two things either deduct the full price of the loco off the price of the scenario or at the very least deduct half the price of the loco from the scenario therefore making it that you would not then be paying for an item that is included in the scenario that you cannot get as you already own the loco,which to me i think is very very fair 9as we all know they wont give you the same thing twice)i know it takes a lot of time and effort to create these scenarios and that people are earning money by creating them so im not trying to do them out of money if dovetail wont or dont want to do this then they should tell the creators not to include locos that have already been released seperately thus making it fair all round.i must point out that i am not a creator nor do i work for dovetail or any of its associates i am just a gamer just like everyone else and thoroughly enjoy it but it as now got to that point where i am sick and tired of paying for locos and then finding a few weeks/months later that a new scenario as been released and contains the locos that i have bought first and that i am still being charged the full price so that i am effectively paying for an item in the pack that i am not going to get as i already own it and know that dovetail wont give a refund for the loco in order to obtain the full scenario pack including the loco.  I dont know what or how other people think/feel about this but it would be great to read some of your comments on this matter do people agree or disagree with me while you writing your comments to this (DO REMEMBER I AM NOT ATTACKING THE CREATORS OR TRYING TO PREVENT THE CREATORS FROM EARNING MONEY AS I FULLY BACK AND SUPPORT THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK) this is aimed at dovetail and its associates only.",1,0

The dungeons are all generated clones of each other, so once you have seen one you have seen them all. The building aspect is limited, nowhere near as robust as minecraft. Trove lacks the serious depth to make you stick around.   Rather than play Trove, just stick to minecraft if you feel like block building and stick to WoW or whatever MMO of your choice for dungeon raiding.",-1,0

5223204,398530,Ghost Cleaner,"I wanted to like this game. I'm a fan of similar games, such as the Peggle series. However, there's absolutely nothing new here. It's almost like they took Peggle, reskinned it, and hung the blocks by strings. That's the gist of it. You shoot a ball, hoping to eliminate all of the pink blocks before you run out of shots. Same as Peggle, except that Peggle had nice twists to the gameplay, whereas 20 some levels in, there's nothing new to keep my interest. The game also has a few game mechanics that are rather irritating. First, some of the blocks will reset if you hit them twice. That wouldn't be a problem, except that you have no clue which ones those are. Also, appearently progressing in the game is dependant on a star system. So after truding through 80 levels, just to finish the game, you are rewarded with a message that says you have to go back, and redo levels to get more stars. Hard to do, when in order to get all 3 stars, you have to break every brick in a level WITHOUT your special weapons. In some stages this is damn near impossible.",-1,0

1770962,229480,Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara,"tl;dr 4 player (Online!) Co-op DnD beat-em-up, With multiple paths for replayability, Secondary weapons and levels. Including added achievements and unlockable concept art!  Do you like Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Are you a fan of the Rules Cyclopedia/DnD Basic? Do you want to see Sticks to Snakes come to life!? All in a four player co-op beat-em-up!?  Then boy, are you in for a treat!  DnD: Chronicles of Mystara is a great package of two all time beat-em-up classics: Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara which have been regarded as one of the best Beat-em-ups ever, now with online multiplayer!  Now for people who have never played the originals, i will explain the basics of these two games  Both Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara are really good beat-em-ups, but what makes them differ from other games of the genre like Streets of Rage or Knights of the Round is the different paths, secrets, Leveling and items like Throwing daggers or Magic rings  During some levels, you are given a choice. For example: In the first stage you are asked to either help a town or chase the monsters to their lair in the mountains. This gives the game a lot of replayability and makes the 1 hour completion time feel not as bad.  I also mentioned secrets, which include all kinds of bonus equipment like the Ring of Damage Resistance +2 and getting all of them will not be easy as some of them are well hidden.  The first game, Tower of Doom has 4 classes to play as: Fighter, Cleric, Elf and Dwarf. Each of the characters levels up as you progress through the game, granting more HP and more spells to the classes who have magic.  The second game, Shadows over Mystara adds a lot of content over ToD like, two more classes: Thief and Magic-user Better inventory, Additional combat moves, smoother controls, faster and better looking spell effects, etc.  Both games boast incredibly good music, like most Capcom games back then and also the graphics look really good and detailed considering their age.  If i had one complaint about these games, it would be the arcade difficulty designed to get as many quarters as possible, but thanks to the infinite quarters, anyone can play through these games. *edit also doesn't support any other controller besides Xbox 360 and PS4, but can be avoided by using x360ce  This game gets my recommendation, so get in there with friends and smack the living daylights out of everything that moves!",1,0

1750558,227940,Heroes & Generals,"The game has alot to fix and trust me it's very rage game. 1. Fix the coruch movement. You go as slow as a slug. It's pratically useless 2. Fix the jumping. It's like your flying in space by the way you jump.  3. Fix the vehicles. Motorcycles don't just spin out of control just randomly from a simple bump. There are hydrolics and they need to be added 4. Add more guns. The grind for something new is really not even worth it. There are barely any guns to the game. When they do add new guns, they keep the same speed but there are more options or, make the grind faster. Lower the amount of XP it takes to get a weapon. 5. Make tanks more powerful. They feel like battlefield tanks. All you do is shoot, get hit shoot, get hit until someone has the least amount of health. 6. THE GRIND. I can't tell you enough how grinding this game is. You have to either put alot of money into this game OR spend all day just trying to get another gun to use. 7. Fix the respawning time. If you get killed by a teammate you get an instant respawn while they have to wait.   The game though is still fun. There are many fun moments to have with friends. Yes i do realize the things are listed may take a while to get fixed. The game is free after all. Free games don't have the greatest Developement team out there but they can make a great game. If they fix these problems, I will be very happy and give it a thumbs up for recommendation.",-1,0

I have all 6 books and i read them all already. I read them in 3 months or a bit more . I have seen TV series . And everytime when i'm reading,watching i have sort of fire inside.I mean that i imagine that i'm in book ,in this story ,and i feel of sorry for heroes of this. I don't know why ,but I always feel sorry for them. So , about this game.  I need to tell you a few words.  We will start from pluses:  +good story  + kinda of open world ,looks sort of.  +new heroes,story  + voices  + you can feel sense for heroes more than in film or in book .  +good nature around you +sounds +you can take equipment,what you want to see on your hero  + a lot of swords,armors,etc .  When i was playing ,i couldn't stop for a while. I had to know more,i had to play more, I forgot about time.  And now about minuses of this game:  - awful gameplay ,i mean it hard to play the first time.  - difficult control of the game  - combat looks very strange and when i had the first battle ,i wanted to unistall this game .  But how you can see,i played it a little and i really enjoyed that. For instance,i had a life with heroes in this fantastic world.  Can i recommend this game?- hm,i don't know. If you have a good nervous system for this game,and you recognized about all minuses and you want to play,just do it.  From my point of view i can give this score for game : 7/10.  Thank you for your time.",1,1

5127954,391540,Undertale,"In all honesty, The humor is funny, the characters I love, but the game is to short, I understand you were supposed to have mercy on the characters but in all honesty I would rather kill emenies to be able to level up and get stronger instead of having the game be that easy.. It feels to simple and boring.. Plus the story just felt incomplete to me.. One how can Toriel and Asgore not like each other and why is Flowey Asriel.. How did he become Asriel? There are so many questions that I feel don't get answered.. Plus it don't feel like an RPG there is no RPG to this game. It's like making a platformer and not having the platformer aspect in there. Plus there is not that much replayablitly to the game.. Yeah there are three endings but in all honesty why have the three endings... One you get tainted forever, the other even if you wanted to get the true ending you couldn't and then the true ending.. Why couln't it of just of been a fun RPG where you level up and kill the enemies... or just knock out the emenies... O and one more thing the game just felt like a glorified Art dodging game.... That not a game...   On our Youtube Channel we will be talking more about it:  https://www.youtube.com/c/DVFightingForce ",-1,0

5932531,523710,Sword Master VR,One phrase to sum it up... JANKY WII GAME! Not sure I have ever refunded a steam game and i'm refunding this... Very disappointed at how incomplete this feels and how I feel totally misled by the trailers. There are number of things wrong with this and i'l try and cover them here. Ultimately it feels like a Wii sword game where you just flail at the right time to win.  1. OMG the hitboxes. These are completely messed up and ultimately what makes the game feel like a Wii sword game.... The shield has a hitbox the size of his mom. It doesn't matter how far you reach around you will most likely hear the clank of the shield even though you are no where near it. I'm not sure why they even have feet because 1 out of 4 times will it actually even register your hit (same with his back and really most all of him).   2. Not accuracy but timing. It's not about how accurate you are but WHEN you swing. If you don't wait for his shield to go down then why swing at all. You can try and be agile and swing under it but while your sword will perfecly cleve through his body you will either hear the clang of the shield or nothing will register. This is infuriating as you will feel you are robbed time and time again!!! I'd say it registered a hit 25% of the time when I carefully planned and swung and saw my sword cleave a major body part in two.... no damage (oh and by the way now you are vulnerable and his sword has touched you accidently and hurt you since he clipped into your body)  3.

3997546,311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I guess people are having problems with FPS and graphics settings. I haven't. I have 2 friends playing as well with no impact to gaming.  It's a CoD game. There isn't anything game changing but there isn't anything so out of place that it makes it a bad game.  It's fast paced action, with a lot of weapons that just feel good, sound good and make you enjoy firing them. The loss of a support class and the length is takes to level up (it just feels longer) are my only real complaints.  Otherwise, it's only been out less then 24 hours, I think everyone should calm the eff down. Yes broken games at launch is a problem, yes all the graphics issues shouldn't be there, but the GAME, not it's problems, feels great and is a solid 8.7 out of 10",1,0
3219017,269790,DreadOut,"After spending 2 hours running around in circles in the school, I finally realized I had absolutely no fun playing this game. The idea is interesting, the atmosphere is kinda right, but as for the rest :  - awful textures (like, ps2-awful or something) (note : apparently, the game was first shipped with '64 bits' textures, supposedly much better, but which were removed for 'performance' problems. I never saw them, and they were never reintroduced despite the initial 'promise') - useless walking pace, meaning you'll have to be running all the time, except you can't run all the time as the character has to catch her breath from time to time - uninspired level design - average and not well presented puzzles (those that I saw, at least). - limbo (when you 'die', you wake up in limbo, which requires you to walk towards a light to start playing again (at least 1 minute lost every time) - not tight enough controls (some of the fights require you to get behind your target, it's a hassle just to do that, and if you miss, chances are you'll get a stuck in a 'loop' of you being knocked down repeatedly by your target, meaning you'll probably end up in limbo-oh-great-not-again ? see above) - camera control has a bad tendancy to 'double' your input, meaning you'll raise it and then immediately lower it, especially when you try to activate it after running (which you do all the time, see above). As the camera is crucial for some events, guess what ? Back to limbo-you-gotta-be-kidding-me again (see above ... again :p) - absolutely no sense of fear after the first jump-scare (if you can even call it that) - minor, but from what I saw, your character doesn't talk, not even answering questions asked by her teammates  I finally gave up after 3 hours, totally bored. This game could have been good, maybe even great, but in the end, it brings absolutely no fun, just frustration, and as such, there's no way I can recommend it.",-1,1

3890294,304730,Train Fever,"Great game in concept but needs some fixing on the train front. Overall a great game, but some of the points below will need fixing before I turn it back on personally, Good Points; 1. Graphics are stunning. 2. Large world. 3. People are dynamic 4. Great choice of vehicles available.  Bad Points; 1. If you have built a decent train line using the track you get in 1850, you will spend hours later in the game removing all of the track, and then replacing it with high speed/electric in exactly the same place! Please put in a feature to upgrade the whole line with either the same way the roads can be upgraded! 2. Being able to lay two way track (and switches) would be a massive help. 3. There is no ability to create road/track, and then commit all at once, this means that if you make a mistake, you have to rip it all up and try again. 4. Creating bridges and tunnels are difficult to plan.  Couple of bits I've not seen mentioned that may improve the game. 1. I would like to be able to choose which platform my route uses. 2. Waypoints would be useful, so that I could pass a fast train seperately to the once on the normal line. 3. I modded a few of the waggons to give me specialised cargo capacity, ie only wood, only iron etc. 4. It is way to easy to make money with the lorries, as they can carry equal amounts of everything, maybe they should also be more specialised...",-1,0

Gameplay seems cool but the Graphics are soo much demanding i cant get a stable 60+ on 1080p ultra with my GTX 1080 i7-4790 16 GB Ram wtf ? and this game has overheating issues for GPU.  Player Base seems to increase only in Free Weekend times to like 5-6 k max normally its about 500-1000 as i saw in the disscoussions. and from the Steam Charts. i dont think you will be able to find any games if the game is only played by 500 people.   to sum up it doesnt just worth the price tag it has there is faaar better games that you can try out with this amount of money.  sad it has a gud potential...      ,-1,0

3728182,298110,Far Cry 4,"Far Cry 4:  Want an accurate, detailed review of Far Cry 4? Look no further.  Ladies and gentleman, Ubishit has done it again. They have created a beautiful and large open world, filled with repetitive collectible items, uninteresting landmarks and more lacklustre content. Go figure!   Positives:  + Graphics for the most part are good, however some weird textures are present even on ultra settings. + As with all Far Cry games, their strength comes from fantastic gunplay, explosions and customisable weapons, which don't fail to disappoint in Far Cry 4. Combat is really engaging and enjoyable. + Some characters have more vibrant personalities in comparison to previous titles, but they are still not very well fleshed out. + I like the addition of rock climbing which adds a new layer to exploration, especially since Kyrat has very mountainous terrain. + Some of the story missions are pretty cool and original. You'll travel to the Himalayas in the snow, take out artillery with c4, capture Opium farms or destroy them (depending on what you choose) + more.   Mixed:  ~ The game can be semi-difficult on the hard setting (which is good). You'll die sometimes if you don't approach situations properly, however most of the time it's a breeze. ~ About 60 hours of gameplay for completionists, a lot less for the main campaign. So it depends on the type of player you are as to how many hours you'll get.  Negatives:  - Little character development, not much is known about the main character Ajay Ghale, or for that matter Amita and Sabal, who are supposed to be leaders of the Golden Path resistance. Not much backstory tieing together how and why Ajay has decided to help the rebels against Pagan Min's army. Story seems weak. Cutscenes are very short, no options to talk, Ajay is rather reserved and just agrees to anything and everything lol. Sometimes a crucial mission decision will be given to the player, but it's far too irregular.  - Hundreds of boring collectibles and around 50 outposts and watch towers combined, which are scattered across the map. These are required to unlock unique rewards and I can see many people tiring over this. As a completionist player I can say this started to get old by the 70% mark, it's definitely not good game design. It really started to wear on me and I just wanted to finish. This is what we've come to expect from Ubishit. A big open world game with potential, then littered with collectible crap everywhere, resulting in no player engagement or story.  - The amount of loot and rewards in this game is insane. You'll never run out of rupees, even if you buy every weapon, all the loot maps, religiously purchase body armour and medkits and restock ammo. It means there's little challenge - resources are all over the place. I've crafted a wallet capable of holding 2million rupees and it is constantly over the 1.4 million mark, despite the fact I've bought every item possible. To be fair I've done a lot of exploring, but it's still unbalanced.  - You'll find a lot of the time you fail stealth missions for absurd reasons or the mission objectives make no sense. 'Kill 3 enemy commanders with an assault rifle'. Why an assault rifle? No one knows..Didn't kill them with an assault rifle? You fail! Try again! On occasion silenced weapons like the .50 cal sniper can be heard by enemies or draw their attention, even with a clean headshot. Kinda useless. Other side quests will ask 'kill the enemy commander silently, then loot his body without being detected'. Again, no explanation as to why this needs to happen, and if you kill all the enemy soldiers silently, leaving the commander for last, all is well. But if you decide to pop them with a machinegun - you fail, commander alerted! Even though he has nowhere to run anyway, lol.  - There's some unrealism present which irked me. Sure it's a video game, but I don't expect a rhino to take 90 bullets from an assault rifle to kill (even on hard lmao) It's simply preposterous. It doesn't make the game feel difficult when you make that design choice, it just makes it ludicrous and laughable as well. I also don't expect an eagle swooping me to drop the health bar by 50-75%. Then there's repairing vehicles, which can be done simply by using a blow torch lol. Heavily armoured enemies can take over 100 bullets to the chest...  - There are a few variations of side quests - bomb defusing, armed escorts, retrieving Golden Path supply drops, destroying Pagan Min's propaganda centres, hunting and assassination tasks, plus a couple of others. Sadly that's all you'll get for the entirety of the game. Again, repetitious content with no meaningful plot behind it. Pointless grinding of the arena for 2 hours, just to get a rare weapon. Lame as ♥♥♥♥.   In summary, Far Cry 4 is more of the same. Nothing new, innovative or exciting (bar a few exceptions). But more of the same works when you've got a formula that has seen past success.   The game is not bad, it is definitely fun, but it does not improve on any of the problems Far Cry 3 had. While Far Cry 3 and 4 have a lot of similiaties, the difference is that Far Cry 3 fixed a lot of problems inherent in Far Cry 2 and hence I scored it higher than Far Cry 4, which fell flat in this regard.  Ubishit sticks to the recipe of collectible garbage, dull, filler side quests, great graphics and amazing shooting.   Put it in the oven and you get...'Meh, getting a bit old, could've been a lot better but it's still cool'  Overall score: 7/10",1,1

2384875,242860,Verdun,"Verdun is a great game for anyone who is a fan of Military games and the First World War but is willing to play a more realistic game than battlefield 1.  GOOD POINTS  The devs have put enormous effort into player models and the maps but also they taken care to have distinctive classes for each nation even if some are clearly better in battle. The game runs smooth and looks amazing at max graphics however i would warn players with bad computers that the experience wont be the same because at lower graphics setting the game doesnt look that good. One thing i enjoy is the one shot- one kill approach the devs have taken which is a refreshing break from games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty where it takes several shots to kill a player.  BAD POINTS I have a few problems with the game however they are not massive. The first one is that at certain times during the day it is hard to find servers with many players in. This therefore doesnt make you want to play the game as much. The second problem is that the respawn times on this game can be as high as 25 seconds which is a very long time to wait. Also i think the core gameplay would benefit from variety in objectives while playing because in the main gamemode you can spend a very long time just advancing, then retreating, then advancing again without that much enjoyment. It would be nice for side quests maybe.  OVERALL To conclude i think Verdun is a very good game for a reasonable price in the steam store and it is highly underrated as a game and i feel like it deserves a higher user base. It has a dedicated userbase and if you enjoy slower, more tactical combat this is the game for you.",1,0

4176299,322330,Don't Starve Together,"This game, at first glance, may not seem too fun. It might look like another one of those cheap survival games, but i will say this. These thoughts should be put aside because their wrong (in my oppinion). This game is one of my favorite survival type video games, and may continue to be it for a very long time. Even though i mainly play this game by myself, it's still a great experience, allowing you to play the ROG dlc for free, and maybe even ship wrecked soon. I know it is called 'Together', but let's face it. Either my computer is a peice of crap, or the servers don't like me because when i play with people, it's like playing in a tar bit. No matter how hard you pull, you'll always be dragged back (rubber banding). But all in all, what really makes this game a great game are the hats. I mean, who doesn't like hats?",1,0

The only saving grace to this game was the multiplayer (or so I thought) because of the character customization, but you're lucky to find a single person playing the game besides you on any difficulty level.

It crashes every single time, I haven't installed any mods or even played a single match. I know my computer can handle the game as I pirated it before I bought it to see if it would play well. I've tried the fix everyone praises fixed their game, it worked one time and got me to the main menu, but I had to restart due to a scrolling issue; I haven't seen the menu since.....   Here's my suggestion:  If you really want to play the game, either buy it on console or pirate the game without the update, at least it will work that way...  EDIT: The issue was with the WIndows 10 Anniversary Update, so after a clean install of Windows 10 and a re-update to the Anniversary Update the game now launches, but will not go fullscreen without a Borderless Window app. It plays well, but I feel highly inconvinienced (I know W10 isn't officially supported, but it's still bothersome when compatibility doesn't work). So if you have Windows 10 build 1607, pass on this.  I brought the issue to 2K support, so hopefully it doesn't happen with 2K17.",-1,0

1960327,233550,Another World,"Looking for the DEFINITIVE version of this game? This isn't really it. I would reccomend the Sega CD version over this. Heart of the Alien isn't a very good game (and was made without Eric Chahi I think), but it's there. Never played this before? This port is decent enough, but it's short, and you will probably dislike the game for the puzzles being really obtuse compared to modern games. It is difficult to suspend disbelief storywise that the main character did exactly everything he had to do without dying, from to all the sidetracking to get past unforseeable deathtraps.  PROS: -The new HD backgrounds are pretty, though sometimes looking hastily made on closer inspection. -Comes with the Sega CD version's soundtrack (Though so does the Sega CD version, since they're just tracks on the disc, and the Sega CD version includes Heart of the Alien soundtrack which is just more of that) -Plays as it should. The game is Another World. They didn't George-Lucas-Special-Edition-up the gameplay/story or anything.  -New Hard Mode adds some new surprises for people who played older versions to death like I have. -No need for passwords. There's now a scene select with actual names for the different 'levels'  CONS: -Plenty of glitches. I found about 6 different ones in less than an hour of play. The achievements are especially glitched, but the most annoying is probably the cursor vanishing until you restart the whole program if you have the pause menu mapped to a controller button and press it twice in succession. -No music during gameplay. Eric Chahi prefers it without, but come on, man. Let me choose. I grew up with ports that did have music and was looking forward to seeing what soundtrack this version used. -HD mode is extremely polygonal. For example: The workers in the background of the first screen of the prison are entirely made up of sharp rhombuses. The corner of Lester's lower leg often juts out from behind the knee. While standard definition mode is really pixellated, sprites come off a little more organic, especially when the pixel edges were masked by the blur of an SD CRT monitor/TV back in the day. I'd say 'The sprites in this game looked better in SD on a CRT' is a pretty major con for an HD re-release.  Who should get this:  Old fans who need to own every version or have no access to any other legal means of playing it. Or if your fondest memories are of the Amiga version (since you can effectively make it just like it).",-1,0

5095034,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"FINAL FANTASY VII is a turn-based RPG that follows the story of AVALANCHE, a group of eco-terrorist trying to prevent Shinra Inc. from draining the life energy right out of the planet.  And then the story derails into something much more complex and dramatic. It's a JRPG at its finest.  The game doesn't add much to the previous installments. It's main new feature is the materia equipment system which is absolutely brillant. You basically equip the materia into individual slots inside your weapon to learn the materia effects. You can learn Fire, Steal, Counter, you name it. You can also link them together like Fire-MP Absorb or Cover-Counterattack. Materia make this game so much more fun and flexible. You can make anybody into any party role. You can get overpowered really fast if you know what you're doing and the strongest materia requires you to work hard for it (sidequest time!)  Another strong feature is the Limit Breaks. In combat, a gauge will fill up when you take damage and you can unleash a powerful attack once the gauge is full. They look amazing and are quite powerful.  The game is simple and pretty linear. It's definitely more easy than hard. Roadblocks are nonexistent. Everybody can only equip one specific type of weapon and anybody can equip the bangles (with very few exceptions) and materias. There is only 3 party members that can enter a battle. The environment is really interactive, you will go up and down ladders and jump small gaps more than any other Final Fantasy game.  The game offers between 35-40 hours of quality storytelling. Those looking to collect and level everything may reach the 70-90 hours count. The party members are a bit odd and doesn't seem to all fit together. It's a varied cast but the story is really centered around Cloud, the protagonist. Cloud is your typical mercenary with a act now, talk later mentality. He's facing issues of his own and the story quickly becomes Cloud's story instead of AVALANCHES's.  Graphics haven't aged well. The models and UI have been improved from it's original state but the pre-rendered background looks old and out of place. The music is as always a masterpiece.  +Strong combat-oriented features (materia system and limit breaks). +A couple sidequests that gives out great rewards. +A couple challeging superbosses to really test out your skills. +Great story. +Memorable music. +Good price.  ~Party members don't quite fit all well together. It's an odd but effective cast. ~Tedious 100% achievements (leveling up materia, getting max gil, leveling to 99) ~Story can get confusing (its sequels and prequels will fill some gaps making the story so much better).  -Graphics haven't aged well (you really should'nt be playing this for graphics though...)  FINAL FANTASY VII grabs our attention with its great combat and keeps us around with a superb story and masterful music. I do recommend at full price.",1,0

3187722,268500,XCOM 2,"EDIT:After much thought and talking to some friends ive decided to give this game another chance. while im open to the idea of giving this game another look and giving the devs a chance to fix the many issues i still stand by what i said in the review below.      The kindest thing i can say about this game is 'EH'  The first part of the game is exciting and gets ya pumped up, then a few hours in its MAJOR problems start to pop up. My little tin foil hat theory is that now that steam is offering refunds the devs make the first 2 hours awesome and then just slip into the 'good enough' mentality   PROS Better looking than the first game, and thats about it.   Cons Horible optimization: I have an awesome rig and had to put all settings in the Low-Medium range No Controler support: Steam controler and third party apps dont count. Timers: almost all missions have a max number of turns for no reason. Forceing you to rush Un-balanced: from the start (even on easy) your way to weak and the enemy is way to strong.    Story This has one of the most mind numbingly stupid plots ive ever heard. it starts like this.  'Hey lets go get our old CO thats been probed by aliens to run the tactics of their forces for 20 years. Yeha where gonna bring him back to our secret base despite having an alien chip in his head that will lead them right to us. Oh and once we get him here where gonna rip that chip out of him, and then he will recover instantly so we can put him in charge of the whole resistance despite the fact that he should have severe brain dammage from not only us ripping that thing out of his head but from the aliens putting it in in the first place. And thats not to mention the mental trama hes gonna have from being a POW for 20 years. That sound good to you guys?......Ok lets do that.'  between the bugs and the poor optimization and the horrible story i have no desire to play another moment off this lazyly made dissapointment.

3365804,275850,No Man's Sky,"So this is a early start to my review.  To start the game launched great took me a couple of restarts to get the game to desired settings and holding a solid frame rate for recording, i dont have a beast system and i am quite aware of what it capable of so this made it a little easier. As for frame rate stuttering and freezes and cradhes i have had none after the first hour of playing, but it will be shure to update if problems arise.  First hour:-  Ok so i started off quickly learning the basics and picking htem up very quick the starter tutorial tips are very clear and easy to follow i spent the hol hour descovering new and wonderful things and mining yes mining there is lots of it but its done in a way to me its not monotonous but of course there is time yet.  The cave systems i descovered where awsome and i thought i had no widlife on the planet but low and behold i turn around and a big ♥♥♥ dinosaur looking turtle elephant lion mouse thing comes over the horizon, so jet pack at the ready i go and take a look to find out its a big softie and i feed it some carbon and it takes me to a run down base with a shuttle that need repairing outside. Now if the game is full of more moments like this and more creatures like this then i am shure i will enjoy my stay in No Mans Sky.  Early taste of the game is it worth it, if you enjoy exploring and mining and finding moments like above then yes, if you dislike any of them then maybe not.  As for problems people have been having i have had none i was realistic of what my pc can handle and made shure all drivers where updated and its running at a smooth 40 fps not 60 no, my pc isnt good enough 40 i am happy with. I will update this with more in a few days so as to give a better idea of the gave overall",1,1

1223565,219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I used to love this game, I really did. I got it a year or two ago and thought it was the best thing I'd ever played. I've been playing it at an average pace since then. I've learned how to drag and feint and all the other exploits and I had a blast.   Then I realized that this game has gone to crap.  The devs have only been releasing skins and items in all the recent updates, and everytime they say they fixed a bug, another 4 pop up. All the combat needs a revision, because I can see an arrow fly above my head, a second passes and then I get killed by it even though it was 10 feet above my sorry ♥♥♥ skull, and people can cut through shields like they were cardboard.   The buttons don't work and the menus are screwed up. And don't get me started on how unfair this game is to new players. All the veterens that have played since the game has come out are at least a rank 30. Being a Intermediate-High rank character myself (I'm around 33 or something like that) I've learned all the combat stuffs and can hold my own against even the most skilled drag queens and feinting goats. Then I realized, I'm one of them now. I had to become one to beat them, I am ashamed of myself for switching to the dark side of the community and exploiting the animation system and hitboxes. 'Dragging' is when a player turns his mouse to a side to either speed up or slow down the swing of the blade and feinting is a game mechanic in which you can cancel an attack by hitting a button.  If you want a game where you will get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by unfair odds, buy DarkSouls or Bloodborne or something. This game is turning into another hat simulator. If you want a game where you have to buy everything to be respected, get TF2 or CS:GO, at least those Dev's still patch the game and try to work with the community. The devs have gotten lazy and greedy. All the updates are just adding items from the workshop as weapon reskins and hats. Rather than trying to revise the things that need revision desperately, they'll release a community made map, or fix a bug where the 3rd bolt of the Mason Knight's right shoe didn't show up properly. Basically, they only release useless or redundent patches.  At this point the game can only get better or get much worse, check it out in a year or two and maybe they'll have fixed things, If not, then this game will live on in the hearts of the veterens and die out. If you really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to get it; do so while it is on sale or when it does another one of it's crossovers with another game, just try to be patient after you've been kicked off of the newbie servers  6/10- Used to be fun, still is at times, good combat if you never encounter Drag queens and feinters, Great fun for Veterens but no fun for new players, unfortunately has begun it's journey to the dark side of Gaming  Pros: +Fun +High potential +Best Medieval combat I've seen  Cons: -Lazy/Greedy Devs -Easially exploited systems -Bug ridden and sub-par maintenance -Lack of attention to where it is really needed by Devs",-1,0

1058288,216910,Of Orcs And Men,"There are many mechanics that are left to be desired and there are several situations in the story line that make you wonder why the devs didn't make it a playable part of the game. That said though this game is a lot better than it gets credit for.   Voice acting isn't the best ever but it's certainly passable. The main characters seem to actually have a team style relationship, which is good since you play both characters throughout the story. Level design isn't amazing, there are a lot of nooks and areas that look like they should be 100% accessible but aren't. But it's also not the worst I've seen.   The game employs a stealth mechanic but there's not a way to stealth through an entire area as you play both characters at once and only one character can stealth. That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's place, it's still very useful.  Overall the RPG mechanics are pretty solid. Both characters get attribute points when they level up as well as a new skill to learn or upgrade. And both characters skills play off eachothers strengths and weknesses quite well. You'll obtain gear from a few chests and sacks or at a vendor, not from combat. Items are upgradeable, but only once and have different attributes that fit a few different play styles.  Combat itself is probably the most dissapointing. You'll have to que up attacks thru a combat menu for each character and watch it take place rather than have direct control yourself. But really as the game progresses the combat mechanics have a more tactical feeling and it starts to become more natural.  You'll get some choices to pick through in dialogue menus, but there's only a couple that actually have any real affect in the game.  I liked my playthrough of this game. The story is kind of fresh feeling, if a bit predictable at times. Gives a feeling of many intelligent species and races, rather than the typical feeling of orcs and goblins being mindless violent beings.

426771,200050,Naval War: Arctic Circle,"I have to admit having played pretty much every Sea Wargame under the sun from the paper version of Harpoon through to Command : Modern Air and Naval I have a bit of a soft spot for this. It is not the prettiest under the sun but its good enough. The interface is a little sluggish and aircraft have the tendency not to do what they are meant to but it seems to balance out well the desire for an accurate simulation and the desire for fun. If I want an all singing all dancing simulation where I can set up any scenario under the sun and run it to see what happens then C:MAN is the clear winner but you don't get the feel from that of blazing ships and harpoons slamming into tankers. For a quick fix then NW:AC meets that.  No one has yet come up with the perfect game. C:MAN would come close if it had more 3D models and had an AI capable of handling itself from a cold start with just named resources. The best for years was Harpoon Classic with Jutland being the state of the art for 3D but some of the other games by people like NWS showed what could be done with minimal graphics. What is needed is someone to join everything up.  Anyway, I digress. As a naval warfare nut I like this as a gentle way to spend the odd few hours.",1,0

3625323,291650,Pillars of Eternity,"So....this game was everything I hoped for and more. Obsidian really set the bar for CRPG's. Beyond that, I think Avellone and company really elevated their game further as far as their story writing goes as well. Just flat out superb, seamless, and fairly well flawless IMO.  There has been a lot written about this game already, obviously, but I will say that with all the hype and all the funding that went into this, the potential for a let down was great, so to have the game not only deliver, but deliver in such grand fashion was amazing.  The character development was deep and fulfilling and the quests actually made sense....rather than just simple fetch and escort quests with no rhyme or reason, everything had an actual reason in this game, and even where they didnt serve to advance the main story, they still had a very real role in filling out the depth of the world itself.  The actual story line itself was pretty gripping. The end of Act 1 gave you the sense of a journey really just beginning, the end of Act 2 was a 'holy ♥♥♥♥!' moment, and the end of Act 3 let you know there was no turning back and that everything was about to get all too real as you approached the end of the game. That doesnt even factor in some of the other, non main quests story lines that develop throughout the game, which are also stellar.  The journey itself was filled with pretty much any emotion you can imagine. The moral choices were often difficult due to the realistic consequences that come with every decision. Speaking of decisions, quite a few of them factor into the ending...and speaking of endings, I cant remember another game that had such a well thought out one. There also seems to be potential for a lot of variations to the ending depending on what choices you made at pivotal moments throughout. My ending was a fair mix of incredibly good and depressingly bad consequences to what I had done during my extensive playthrough. I loved that fact.   I am thoroughly impressed with this game, and I have to give it the edge over Baldurs Gate 2 as maybe the best CRPG of all time, and a top 5 all time great game from any genre.  I have a lot more to say, but so vast was the story and so deep the experience, that I think maybe it's better if I leave the rest unsaid and let you form your own opinion instead.   Play this.  Can there be a 15 out of 10? Because seriously, I think that is how I am going to rate this game.",1,1

2657437,250620,Among the Sleep,"Short, but sweet, this is almost your typical first person horror game, except there's a twist: you're a toddler. The gameplay mainly revolves around a 'find the thing' mechanic that has you crawling, walking, pushing, and pulling your way across several locales while occasionaly avoiding some manner of big bad. In this respect the game is most similar to  Slender  in many respects although with a definite focus on surreal visuals that coupled with the distorted perspective of a small child create a much more atmospheric experience. While the game has more bark than bite in the horror department and the story (such as it is) doesn't so much unfold as fall into your lap toward the end, Among the Sleep is quality experience. Though the $20 price for less than 3 hours of non-repetition warranting gameplay is a bit steep, I'd still recommend checking this title out, though you may want to wait for a 50% off sale.",1,0

5364934,411370,MELTY BLOOD Actress Again Current Code,"I play a lot of fighting games. But if there's one game I will take to a deserted island, it would be Melty Blood. Me and my siblings have been playing this for ~13 years.  Originally released in December 2002, this is a visual novel that happened to have a fighting game minigame. This was long before BlazBlue introduced the idea to the mainstream. The game's story is a continuation of Tsukihime and (surprisingly), is canon and explains how dead characters returned to life to fight with the small roster.  The original game was broken. A lot of moves have shield frames (meaning, if this move hits another move, no damage is done but you can cancel to a different move) which lead to anime-esque fights with freeze frames everywhere as players switch moves to try to break through. Also, the post-victory screen will not end until the defeated character is on the ground. Meaning, if you killed your opponent while they're on the air, you can juggle them almost infinitely before the round will officially end (like other airdashers, the longer a combo is, the heavier the opponent becomes).  Regardless, this game has a lot of innovations. Some of them are: - This game has 3 buttons and a dedicated shield button (think of it like Street Fighter V Ryu's parry but you can cancel to other moves) - which makes each character easy to play.  - Melty Blood has no chip death making to exciting matches.  - Characters can use their meter to gain a new gauge (called HEAT) that slowly goes down. During this time, the character regenerates life AND stops the clock. This makes the timer an important resource to manage. It is common for a player to stop the clock when its almost over and run away (or rushdown) to maintain the lead. - Super moves on a successful parry during HEAT.  Later expansions in the series include Re-ACT (PC), ReACT Final Tuned (PC), Act Cadenza (Arcade), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PS2), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PC), Actress Again (PC), Actress Again Current Code (PC). ...if you think Street Fighter's naming convention is crazy, French Bread has taken it to the extreme.  The game released on Steam will have the following features: - More characters! There are now 31 characters. - Each character have 3 different fighting style which each plays completely different. Effectively, this game has 31 multiply by 3 characters - Balance - Updated story (very important for those who wanted more Tsukihime)  This game is so popular that it was referenced in the Type-Moon fan-service OVA, Carnival Phantasm.   The Melty Blood fighting community love this game so much, that we have no problem playing the grand finals at a parking lot or airport lounge. This is how dedicated we are to this game.  If you haven't played this gem and you love fighting games, give Melty Blood a shot. Who knows? Maybe you'll be airdashing with the rest of us for the next 13 years.",1,1

Beautiful game with a story that you'll actually care about, information about Alaskan culture that you'll be interested to soak up and beatiful graphics are all positives.  The game is a little rough around the edges in terms of mechanics, at least when playing solo. But they are minor irritations when viewing the game as a whole. I felt a bigger emotional attachment with games like Journey and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons than this, but I'm not sure that it really warrants the comparison. This game stands on it's own feet and is still some of the best £/hour entertainment I've had of recent years.  8/10",1,0

5819819,493340,Planet Coaster,"This game has potential to be very enjoyable, but it feels incomplete and has many bugs.   Pros:  - graphics - intuitive roller coaster building tool  Neutral:   - non-existent management part, park practically manages itself, no shortage of money - game heavily depends on steam workshop, where you can find loads of content  -- this is not a positive for me, because built-in content is very limited - very resource intensive for this kind of game  -- plays semi-ok on i5 4570, GTX 750ti and 8 GB RAM  Cons:  - camera movement is bad - building a path is a chore - career mode is underwhelming and too easy - limited selection of rides in game (compared to predecessors) - no weather changes - cumbersome ui (especially if you try to micromanage) - various minor bugs during building process  If you are creative and play to build beatiful park only, this game is for you dispite the bugs and anoyances. If you play for management part and career mode, you will be disappointed. I would give this game 6/10, or neutral rating, but because steam allows good/bad rating only, I am forced to not to recommend.",-1,1

With a variety of several great retro-80's levels, enjoyable techno as a battle anthem, and a whole suite of weapons to unlock and kill with, this game leaves nothing to the imagination, as you can kill in some pretty gruesome ways with some unjoyable and yet classic weapons. The story isn't much, but it's enough to go on for a game like this. WARNING, this game is VIOLENT. Also, it can be very frustrating at times, but it's fast pace will allow you to see past. But I will note it can be very annoying when dying at certain points, and you are very mortal, as you have, and are, a one hit kill.

Its a perfect example of what one should do with early access games.  I know when I beat this game it will be the most fulfilling experience I will have had in gaming in years. Thank you so much for making something fun and different.,1,1

2883082,253290,FOTONICA,"The too-easy summary - Rez meets an endless runner.  It's a bit more than that. You run. Endlessly. Well, until you run out of platform to run on. Hold a button, run faster. Release the button, jump. Hold it again to cut the jump short &amp; land again &amp; start running. It's all about timing those jump/interrupts to land on the next platform you want.  Did I mention it's all first person, with a trippy rez-like vector graphic presentation where the world &amp; environment builds up over the duration of the level in time with the music? It's tough arcade 'one more time' gameplay, with killer controls &amp; level design.   It's not particularly deep, but it's a well designed challenge &amp; is focused on doing one thing well - an incredibly cool kinetic feeling of powerful jumps.",1,0

4421090,339580,Ember,"Just finished Ember and I have to say I was quite impressed. After picking it up for $4 bucks on the steam winter sale, I didn't know what to expect. I can honestly say this was the first time I picked up a game on sale and felt that I had ripped off the developers, because Ember is worth more than 4 bucks. I think it is even well priced at it's regular $10.   For a $10 rpg, the graphics are quite polished, sound and music are solid, and an above average story and world. I really liked the concept of the Embers from start to finish, and I would happily visit this world again in a sequel. There are some really fun and enjoyable settings and locals. You have your standard fantasy trope levels (Graveyard: Check, Sewer: Check, etc) but they all felt distinct and connected at the same time.   One thing I have to mention are the books. In Skyrim, you find a book, open it to the first page to see if you get a bonus skill and then drop it. Some are ok, but most are meh. Here I found myself reading book after book, even going so far to keep an eye out for Book 3 of a series I had read one and two of. There are some great stories bound in those tomes, so don't take them for granted.  Very solid game for the price. It is a little on the light side in terms of complexity and depth, but considering the price I think it works.   Cheers and Happy Gaming!",1,0

3050050,262940,Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse,"The first Broken Sword and its first sequel remain among my favourite point-and-click adventure games. (Remember to check the Director's Cut versions of those games!) #3 and #4 changed the art style (to 3D) and lost some of the magic in the process, although those aren't bad games either. After that, it took a long, long time for the fifth game (back to gorgeous 2D) to come out. Based on the middling reviews, I wasn't expecting much. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised.  The new 2D art is beautiful. More importantly, the opening scenes in Paris re-capture the atmosphere of the early games. The characters - George and Nico et al - remain the same, love'em or hate'em.   The game feels stuck in the past. That is not ENTIRELY a bad thing. However, it means that the interface is clunky; inventory is messy; puzzles can be obtuse; there's even a goat puzzle involved (!). Luckily there's a VERY useful hint system incorporated. Whenever I got stuck (every 30 minutes or so), all I had to do was to click the 'hint' button.  If you don't like old-school adventure games, this game is probably not for you. If you have no prior experience with the series, many of the inside references and jokes will be lost on you. And you should really start with the first game. That one's a better game. But this one FEELS right, like an authentic Broken Sword game - even down to replicating the flaws and quirks of the original. For nostalgic fans of the series, especially of the first two games, this one is a worthy sequel.   Rating: 8/10",1,0

4577834,35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"A Batman game worthy of its praise  After having played Batman: Arkham Knight, I decided to take a few steps back and see where the series all began. You may wonder why I would want to go back after playing Arkham Knight on a next-gen platform. The reason lies in the fact that I couldn't get enough of the gameplay mechanics. The fast-paced combat is fun and exciting while trying to figure out how to take down nearly eight armed guards without being spotted makes me feel as though I really am Batman. However, every game has its downsides. Boss fights against Titan-fueled henchmen can become repetitive and the Killer Croc portion of the game slows the pace of the game down to a near halt. The final boss against the Joker himself is also too easy for a final boss fight and leaves me wanting more. Yet, even with boss fights like these, some such as the ones against Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn are quite interesting. Overall, this game is worth the $20 on Steam if you are a fan of Batman.",1,0

The Story is enthralling and the voice acting and graphics are brilliant. The cut scenes are Cinematic and interesting...but can be skipped if you're on a second playthrough.  There's a ranking system for the Enemies, which means that if they kill you, they get promoted...so bear that in mind!

1049057,215630,Demonicon,"As a longtime fan of the Dark Eye pen and paper rpg, I was intrigued when I heard about Demonicon. An action-rpg in the Black Lands, dealing with the legacy of Borbarad - sounds good, at least in theory. Let's see how it holds up:  Liked: - the content is mature (little SPOILER: there is a budding incestous relationship between our main protagonists) - the gameplay is on average pretty smooth, barring a few hiccups - the setting has been almost painstakingly recreated and the details border on continuity porn (if you don't know what that is, look it up on  tvtropes.org)  - the story manages to pull you in and doesn't let up until the very end, with tough decisions, whose results you only see after a while, but for some there is always a third option depending on your skills -superb VA (at least in the german version, haven't tried the english yet; little spoiler: your father has the german voice of Liam Neeson)  Disliked (well not actually disliked, but more puzzled by): - a couple of glitches in the graphics, nothing major or gamebreaking; I've seen a lot worse in AAA titles - something in the story progression that didn't make a lot of sense (SPOILER: you beat a powerful and annoying Rondrian and loot the armor from his corpse, only to be immediately offered a better demonic version by a demon - what's up with that?)  Bottom line: IMO Demonicon felt like a somewhat quality-reduced clone of The Witcher 2, which is a superb game and thus Demonicon managed to be at least a good game. If you liked The Witcher 2 and you need to pass some time until The Witcher 3 arrives, then Demonicon is the game for you. If you're a fan of The Dark Eye, then Demonicon is also for you, since this is the only game besides Drakensang that made me feel like I was actually walking through Aventuria. Everybody else, it's up to you.",1,0
4247343,326180,Sinister City,"The positive reviews that convinced me to give it a try claim that this game is misunderstood satire. What they don't say is that it's bad, poorly made, and glitchy as hell 'satire' (let's be honest though, this is not satire, this is a parody). Even its puzzles are a laugh (to a point where one could theorize that maybe it wasn't intended as a parody of the vampire genre but of HOGs -hidden object games- in general).  Yes, it has a couple of funny moments here and there and yes, it's real cheap, but that doesn't make it a good game that's worth your time.  If you get it at it's current sale price (0,09 cents) you won't lose any money, since it has trading cards, but again, this doesn't make it a good game, just an affordable one.  If you like over-the-top, absurd comedies that feature vampires and don't mind glitches that could prevent you from finishing the game, then yes, it's worth it. You'll get a couple of chuckles and I have to admit, a funny HOG is a rare and refreshing thing. But that's about it.  I am tempted to give it a thumbs-up for it's campy glory, but it has some of the worst glitches I've ever seen in HOGs and that's one of the biggest faux-pas a game of this genre can have. I can stand bad art, bad or non existent voice acting, a flimsy plot and random fetch quests. But I have to be able to play the game, to say that it's at least mediocre, don't you think?",-1,1

3339283,274290,Gods Will Be Watching,"There are currently a number of issues with the game that force me to be unable to recommend a purchase at this time.   For example, during the first stage, despite reading the verbal and non-verbal cues adquately, the hostages do not appear to act in line with their mental state. This is, for many people (read the forums), considered a bug that needs fixing before the first level is adequately enjoyable or even completable without simple luck.   Further issues have been raised regarding the second stage, and a transitional story/immersion breaking incident between the second and third stages.   I am fully aware that the game is supposed to be difficult, but there's difficult and near impossible - even on the advertised 'easy' mode.  The developers need to read the forums and answer the concerns raised, dealing with the perceived issues in urgently-needed patches. Once these issues have been resolved, I expect to be able to change my recommendation accordingly.",-1,0
4278718,329440,Sonic Lost World,"I preordered it because I, like everyone else, was hungry for more decent sonic games I don't have to kill my phone for, so I also got all-stars racing which I will review on its own page.  It's polished* and beautiful**. *Once you get it running right on your system, which is a fairly simple research/learning experience. **Although it's not the 'realistic' artform we've come to expect.  This game, introduces a new element to sonic's movement profile. I really enjoy learning and perfecting the parkour, jumping from wall to wall and using momentum to run straight up walls like some blue 3' tall jackie chan on speed, just feels right for sonic and incredibly fun. We've seen him do these things in game cut scenes! As fun as this is, it deminishes knuckles' ability to climb or tails' ability to fly, since all but the highest platforms are now accessable to sonic.  This game also gives us back the wisps, which I rarely find myself using, and thats the way it should be. Perhaps in future games, they should be present but not pushed into your face (maybe placed in hidden difficult to reach areas), and more like a cheat to get past a difficult agility or combat obstacle rather than a necessity.  Speed? Ugh...For some reason the only time Sonic runs is after hitting a dash pad. I get it, the focus of this game is platforming, and there are plenty of areas where running fast would be a bad idea anyway, but you're not really given enough time to explore per mission. Is this a ploy to force replayability? Because you 'gotta go fast?' I hate to think that, but unless you know where the special areas are by stumbling upon them or watching youtubes, you won't have time to look for them.  Unfortunately, once again, you are on sonic lock. There is no option to play any other character.  I've heard tell that this is just a blue copy of some mario game, but I don't know, I'm not a mario fan. I've always been a sonic nerd, since the origional release of sonic 1, and I will continue to play until the seriese is buried (and probably after that too).  All of the above don't paint the game in the greatest light, so I will say it explicitly: The game is fun, challenging at times, with some replayability, I would say it's worth it if you're ok with the price for a sonic game without the speed we expect.",1,0

If you're somehow new to Killing Floor, I'll give you a breakdown of the main gameplay loop: shoot zeds, earn money, buy guns, throw dosh, back to shooting zeds, rinse and repeat, then boss.

5205022,395200,Ben and Ed,"This game is amusing for about twenty minutes, about as long as the novelty of having limbs removed without dying lasts. After that, it hits some serious pitfalls. You're tasked with running along very narrow paths, avoiding traps (sawblades, swinging obstacles) to make it between checkpoints. It's not uncommon for these obstacles to come from behind the camera, making them very difficult and frustrating to try and avoid. The player character easily ragdolls when hit and takes some time to recover. When trying to negotiate narrow paths, this means any hit or mistake is usually your last, as you flop helplessly over the edge of the level. This quickly becomes needlessly frustrating, and takes a lot away from a game with a great concept. The music is extremely short loops and quite repetitive, so if you find yourself stuck on a level it can fast become grating. Controllers are supported, but not in menus, and there's no remapping/control scheme guide.  There's a lot of sadly wasted potential in here, but I can't recommend this due to it's poor execution, frustrating level design and lack of polish.",-1,1

6033929,570,Dota 2,"DOTA 2 is a really good game in very aspects. In my opinion, these are the things that make it one of my favourite games.  - Great game without P2W (Pay2Win); all the items that are available in the shop are ONLY for your heroes to look nicer. By the way, almost all the items look pretty cool and are totally worth the money you spend on them.  - The game has awesome graphics and you don't need a very good PC to run it normally.  - You can become a pro player for absolutely no cost.  - Have tons of fun with your friends (once again, TOTALLY FREE).  - More than 100 heroes to choose from. Find the one that fits you most.  However, there are some negative sides:   - There are Russian players in every server, and they can't speak English very well, what makes teamwork almost inexistible sometimes.  - The community can sometimes insult you for making mistakes when you are playing your first games, instead of helping and teaching you how to do something correctly.   In my opinion, this game is WAY better than League of Legends, I don't understand why do so many people play LoL when they have a game like this.  10/10",1,0

4861193,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"First of all if like to end the first question that comes into your mind when you see this review, 'you have only played for 33 minutes so how can you write a review?'. I can write a review after spending this little amount of time in the game simply because i have played this games pre-desessors and can easily compared them.  The problems that i have personally found; Level Design Mechanics Creativity Structure Layout Lazyness, i can see how much you have stole from other games  Level Design. Dark Souls 3s level design feels rather unappealing in a lot of ways but is generally okay, there couldve been more love and creativity in a lot of areas and I feel like they really didnt try to fully develop the game the way that they should. The Catacombs are the catacombs, the demon ruins are the demon ruins, anor londo is anor londo, undead settlement is bloodborne. I can feel the lack of fun and the more pressure being put on them by Bamco. This game has no original concepts and pretty much all of its features are mimics and stolen ideas from the previous games. This game feels to me as if Dark Souls 1 and 2 were smashed together.  Mechanics The new mechanic to the game has been on my mind since i first saw someone play this game and what i dont understand is the point of it. Dark Souls had its way of limiting spam casting and that was from the number of times you can use them, this felt to me like what we selected was an old scroll which could only be used so many times before it was unuseable. Now its ben turned into the equilivent of mana... NO, NO, NO, STOP. Yo udont change something that had no problems and especially not to replace it for something that is used in almost every other game...  Furthermore The game is filled with untested, or generally missing mechanics, hyper armor is finnicky on a lot of weapons and poise is 100% absent. People keep testing to find out what it does and so far every single one has been disproven. Some enemies and some areas are flatout ruined by this missing poise  If a new souls player isnt interested in the PvP, hes better off playing Dark Souls 1 since its a more challenging and, in my opinion, a better designed game. The world design is so much more intertwined and strung together geniously, and while the game is a technical mess being one of the worst optimized games ive ever played on PC, I still dont mind it  Gameplay is intended to be much faster than previous entries, and feels very different from the more methodical gameplay of Dark Souls II - Roll's are faster and have a much cheaper stamina cost. Unfortunatley, this also means that certain enemies and bosses spam ludicrous attacks that force you to roll constantly and hope you wind up in the right spot. The Dancer in particular has this problem, and I often found that the best stratergy in this game is to cheese bosses out and try and make their harder phase as short as possible.  The mechanics also lack depth - Powerstancing is gone, and because rolling is easier, the punishing and methodical PvP from Dark Souls II is gone, along with the build diversity. There's no powerstancing, no I-Frames on backsteps, and less varied movesets. Most of the time, there is simply no incentive to do anything other than R1 in both PvP and PvE. PvP suffers the most here - why bother using an R2 when your R1 will also stagger, cost less stamina, and will, unlike the heavy attack, combo into a second hit.  ",-1,1

Games like Bubs the Bobcat and Aero the Acrobat were, for all intents and purposes, replicas of Sonic right down to the title of the game. Some were good and some were fairly derivative. Freedom Planet, much like those games, recaptures what we loved about the Sonic 2D platformers of the Genesis age, but it lies in the first category.

1889205,232430,Gone Home,"First off, this is not a game in the traditional (stereotypical sense). Gone Home plays out more like an interactive visual novel, with no choices from the player's perspective, but exploration. If you don't like walking through a game, stop reading. If you do: This game was very enjoyable. It's short (I finished it, complete with reading aloud all of the notes you find, in a little under 2 hours) but I found it immersive. I was a little annoyed at how the game tricks you with its overbearing 'horror story' games that just hide a coming of age story, but I appreciate the distraction now because it made the game a bit more of a game and less of a story. The story is solid, if you're a fan of the message. If you're a crazy right-wing machine with no empathy, skip it. This is a story about a girl dealing with real issues in the 90's.  TLDR: Good nontraditional game with a solid story. 'Horror overtones' are unnecessary distractions. Short, but sweet. Pick it up when it's on sale.",1,0

Played this nonstop the first few weeks after lauch.  I really wont bother to comment on the PvP and endgame too much, as you can read everything else posted here. If you like to grind nonstop mindlessly, you may not mind the endgame, but the dropoff in quality was fairly pronounced imo. I only made it to around level 30 in the DZ before I hung it up. There just isnt any payoff and the random battles you'll have aren't very engaging or balance, both real player and npc. Few times I hopped on since updates, I was either falling through maps, or being kicked from groups for too low of GS (which didnt exist when I started) or kicked for not realizing they were using some exploit and aggro'ing the ai. Gave that up quick.  Great game, but not a long term one for those who hate the grinding. If you can set that aside I still think its worth playing the story at least once, ONLY with the half off sales from time to time.   In short, I'm glad to have played it and feel like a herb for buying the gold package(lesson learned), but truly wouldn't recommend it if you're really expecting longevity of play.

The performance of this game is so bad, At the first time I can even start the game properly I got the black screen with only sound effect from the menu selection. I have to restart the game to switch back between onboard GPU (Intel HD4600) and dedicated GPU (GTX850m) about 4 times to make it work and also this game still has the problem when I try ti ALT+TAB out of the game in the second time the game will freeze my computer (actually a notebook with Core I7 4710HQ RAM12GB with GTX850M 2GB GDDR5) and I have to force shut down  And Thirdly, When I managed to make it in a playable state.

5092420,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"Memories... This game evokes many. I first played Final Fantasy VII in 1998 since I was late to the PSX party; it was the entire reason I made it a point to purchase a Playstation in the first place. I had just turned 15 and had the entire summer ahead of me. This was probably my tenth playthrough of FFVII and the first time I've touched the game since 2004.  I was excited to sit through the intro as Midgar slowly comes into view again and we gradually see the full expanse of the mako megapolis in all of its glory, spouting geysers of planet energy into the air miles above the upper plate. Seeing Aerith's face slowly appear on my screen reminded me of an angsty, heartbroken 15 year old version of myself that could never forgive the game developers for doing what they did, even though what they did is probably what cemented this game in my mind as one of the all-time greats. They got me emotionally invested, which probably isn't very hard to do with a 15 year old - let's be real. There are critics everywhere and I respect their opinions on why FFVII is flawed - but I'm here to share why I think it's great and has withstood the test of time.  Let's start out with the setting. Inconsistent? Maybe a little. Fun and interesting? Absolutely. Midgar (especially at the time of the game's release) was unlike anything ever seen in a video game before. It was dark, gritty and full of danger. Your capital city isn't supposed to be crawling with monsters and infested by extremely unsavory folk at every turn. I mean EVERY turn. We aren't talking your staple renegade rogues and bandits, either. We're talking a group of eco-terrorists, a brothel with all kinds of sexual deviants, and a Kingpin pimp with the rule over the most lustrious town in the slums. Not to mention you have ShinRa's hitman shadowing you in the very early stages of the game: Reno. Most of this was unheard of in video games, especially a game that garnered as much attention as Final Fantasy VII did and still does. Clearly, there was a good formula at the start.  Leaving Midgar, you begin traveling to other towns which are typically much smaller and far less populated as well as more peaceful... if they haven't been ravaged by ShinRa, Inc. Some favorite locations for me personally, in no particular order include:  Fort Condor -- It's small and there's hardly anything going on there. Two people to talk to, but this place first gave me the initial sense of desperation people feel towards ShinRa (outside of AVALANCHE and some other Midgar residents) as they fight to protect the near-extinct Condors, one of which happens to be nesting atop the Mako Reactor built there.  Costa del Sol -- Swing by and have a Tropical Nights at the bar! Costa del Sol was the first town in Final Fantasy VII I felt like I could relax in (the short run-in with Hojo aside). Finally I seemed to be out of ShinRa's grasp for a little bit and had some chill time. The music and ambience of this town is the first like it I really got to experience in such detail; it felt like a fun, albeit short, reprieve for the crew. Everyone split up and gave you the opportunity to have brief dialogue with each member of your party.  Nibelheim -- One of the creepiest towns outside of Silent Hill. You walk into Nibelheim and you automatically know something's wrong (outside of it just being there alone since it should be ash). The townsfolk are all obviously hiding something and just simply either chuckle at you or demand that you leave. Nibel Mansion is one of the most unsettling places around, although I think they could've done better with enemy choices for this location to expand upon that, the music is chilling as you venture deeper and deeper into the mansion to try and uncover the mysteries it hides.  Wutai -- It's like Beijing and Kyoto got mashed together hundreds of years ago with pretty awesome results. Wutai is one of the biggest locations you can visit outside of Midgar and even has a large mountain - Da Chao - in which you can participate in a sidequest to rid yourself of a slimy pimp and settle an old score once and for all. The Pagoda is my favorite. Influenced by Bruce Lee's 'Game of Death' there are five floors for the spunky young ninja Yuffie to fight her way up in 1 on 1 combat before meeting the Grandmaster in a deadly fight for supremacy, and pretty good rewards.  I like most locations in FFVII and could keep talking about them for awhile, but let's skip all that. Next, I want to talk about some COMBAT.  FFVII sports the ATB System which allows you to increase or decrease the speed of battle at your leisure - personally, I have to go full throttle in games like this, but to each their own. Materia is engaging but not so comlex that it will make you walk away scratching your head in frustration. It's fun to level up and see new spells get unlocked as well as find new Materia. My major gripe with Materia is that the stat adjustments (some would give you -02% HP, for example), were pretty inconsequential; especially with the introduction of HP / MP Plus Materia. I like the cause and effect game and trying to work through it more. There are several different Materia types which I'll break down here:  Magic (Green) Materia: Magic Materia covers all of the elements such as Fire, Lightning and Ice. There are a number of others as well. You start off with Fire, Bolt and Ice as the basic spells of these Materia and as you win battles, your Materia basically gains experience as well and will eventually evolve to its next stage and unlock a higher tiered spell for most. This was very interesting as in other games it just seemed to be either done at a random level some character would learn a new spell for the most part - FFIII for SNES being one of the exceptions also.  Summon (Red) Materia: Ever feel like calling forth a primordial beast from the depths of the netherworld to wreak havoc upon your enemies? Yeah? Well, you should probably get mental help. Summons are bad ♥♥♥ incarnations that are... summoned, and do heavy damage to all enemies. Most of these guys are elemental based as well and they range from an Ice Queen to the Lord of the Underworld all the way up to a mecha-Godzilla looking Dragon that blasts your enemies from outer space with the force of a nuclear bomb. I can dig it.  Command (Yellow) Materia: This Materia is very versatile in that it enhances a character's actions or unlocks new actions for the character utilizing the materia. For example, throw Double-Cut on Tifa and she will attack twice in a row with a physical attack instead of the normal one time. Sense Materia allows you to view the HP/Status of an enemy at any time when used, and you can even use your Gil as a weapon to hurl at your opponents - the more you throw, the more damage is done.  Support (Blue) Materia: Also very useful, allowing you to cast basic single targetting spells on all enemies and even allowing you to Steal when you perform a certain attack that you have the Materia linked with.  Independent (Pink) Materia: Covering your allies is always useful if you have someone who can take a lot of punishment. Some of this Materia is good and useful early in the game - later on, it feels pretty broken though. I would've liked to have done without.  I did get Materia Master on this playthrough and it was very gratifying for me, personally. Though I will warn you, it is time consuming and there are a few Materia that you can miss and if you do: you will not get the achievement on that playthrough.  Combat is fast and exciting for awhile and if you're a gaming masochist like me, the Battle Arena at Gold Saucer can be really fun, especially if you go there at lower levels. Some of the Materia combos just make this game busted at higher levels. I think Ruby and Emerald Weapons (the super bosses of this game) each got two to three hits on me before I annhilated them.   Out of room here. Part II will come later. Thanks",1,0

This is a game that you will either absolutely love and play a lot, or you will hate it.  The ArmA games aren't easy to learn by yourself. It takes time and patience to become fluent in the controls. You need to approach them with an open mind.  Great versatility for mods and modders.

3369551,275850,No Man's Sky,"This is a great game. Don't listen to the haters. Here is what the game is not. It is not CoD in space. It is not Star Citizen. It is not a dog fighting game. It is not Alien Isolation. It is not a AAA game. This is an indie game. It has a minecraft-esc gathering/crafting system, and is all about exploring and finding new things. I have played the game for almost 2 hours now, I haven't even left the first solar system. I spent a full 1.5 hours on the first planet. I learned a bunch of alien words, found a monalith, got a better mining gun, and now am looking for a way to craft fuel to get out. It is a very immersive exploration game, and it is perfect at what it does. I love this game and know for sure that I will be spending a long, long time on it.   If this does not sound like the kind of game that you do not want to play, then by all means, go play CoD, or some other game. It does not mean that this game sucks. What it means is that this game is not for you.  Update on 10/2:  I stand by my review of this game. I really don't get the hate at all. I have stopped playing it for a bit, due to work and not having time to play really anything, but I plan on playing it more soon. So glad I have this gem in my library.",1,1

3965613,310560,DiRT Rally,"I'm not going to give this a thumbs down due to my poor experience with this game. But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.  I've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.  Another thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.  The car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you.   And lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to 'recover' your car and put up with being severely time penalised.  If you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.  Big ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.",1,0

After installing and quickly clicking through the in-game tutorials I thought I was in for another city-building strategy game. This game isn't really a city builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading bandits or any military tech. Micro managing your town to protect your people from the elements, disease and starvation while expanding the population and maintaining the workforce all at once is plenty enough.   There is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader on the river. Trading resources your town has stockpiles of for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies is the only way to bring diversity to your towns diet and obtain resources you otherwise couldn't produce. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, as every map is randomly generated and can differ with resources and geographics. Not one plan will work for every town which will bring replayability.  There is no winning in Banished, you either get it right and flourish or your people starve to death over the next cold winter.",1,0

3889679,304730,Train Fever,"So, you know, this is my first Review ever.  I bought this game a week ago, date of this review is 05.02.2015.  I have, at this time, 88h in the game, and i dont regret one single hour.  This game, as it is, is a fresh feeling game for me. I tried a lot of games, i played a lot of games, and this game feels fresh and accesable to everyone from beginner to veteran.  At this point, the game is very well playable and even after you know the drill of how to run your company, every game you start, feels different and gives you different options.  In my Opinion this game is, atleast for the late game part, for people who got no problem with putting a lot of time into it to get that perect train connection, that perfect busline and so on.  Of course, as it is with new games, it has some trouble to get through. For me, the most remarkable problem is the late game lag. I dont know if its just for me and my computer, but the Lag in the Late Game ( eg. Big Cities, lots of stuff going on ) gets annoying at time. There are some Bugs, but its nothing that would destroy your gaming experience, for example dont let you do certain things.  I just want to note here, that the modding community does fantastic work and the devs are, at this point, working closely with the community and let them create stuff for the game, that they can then release in future updates and gives the devs more time, for vrious other improved.  So, to sum it up, if you like a solid Tycoon game, that does nothing special, but what it does pretty decent, you like trains etc., you wont regret this game.",1,1

What I found was not only a most excellent simulator of that strange and wonderous machine known as the marketplace, but also cleverly interwoven simulations of the murder-and-riches-filled hole in the ground and the confusing morass that is society. Recettear is a game for our era. It explores all the great questions of our era through the saga of that iconic hero of the West, the starving entrepreneur. It touches upon such themes as love, loss, homelessness and hunger while also seeking to transcend them through good and honest capitalism. Yet most importantly, it touches upon the most wonderous power of free exchange, namely that two people can each better their lives through the simple modicum of trade. My inner poet wept, my inner economist exulted and my whole self basked in the divine joy of commercial success.",1,0

1049276,215630,Demonicon,"The game tries hard to borrow from The Witcher series and Bioware rpgs, but fails at almost every aspect and mechanic aside from story, which is surprisingly fun. Being a storyfag myself I was ready to forgive the many shortcomings, but the ending managed to nullify whatever positive feelings I had for Demonicon: it is a 5 second long cg which doesn't depend on any of your previous choices and actions, forcibly railroaded, makes little sense (behold a deus ex machina 1 minute before the boss fight) and is simply annoying. So you get an insulting 5 second cg, credits and then main menu - no slides, no scenes, nothing. In comparison to this a Mass Effect 3 original ending can be considered a masterpiece.  As for the game in general, the pros: - Story is entertaining, characters are ok and generally make sense. - The world of Dark Eye looks much more interesting and atmospheric than in the previous DE game Drakensang, where it felt as a boring generic fantasy. - All non-combat skills have uses, if only to get junk loot. - Choices have consequences, though mostly in dialogs and cosmetic map changes. - Comprehensive codex of the game world and plot.  The cons: - No manual saving, can sometimes take up to 15 minutes to hit the next save trigger. - No key remapping (enjoy shift-4 for potion). - Combat is clunky and unbalanced, also animations are so long it almost feels like a phase based and not real time (reminded me of The Witcher 1 combat). - Side quests are few and are a joke, on the quality level of the infamous Dragon Age 2 'deliver a random item you find to some dude' quests. - Very limited exploration - nothing to find but some random junk loot (weapons, armor and talismans are only rewarded for plot quests or bought in shops), and a couple of combat hints codex entries, some of which require one of the skills to get like pick locks or perception. - Linear story progression and basically nothing to do beyond that. - Economy is broken, you get rich fast and there is little need for money. - Alchemy is generic and also useless since you find more potions than you generally need and even on harder difficulties it's easier just to buy them. - Graphics are outdated, customization is limited to armors which are few.  Misq: - The only dialog choices here are to inquire some info (sometimes requires lore or fast talk checks) and major plot choices, yet the protagonist often speaks as if player is randomly alternating between calm and aggressive options. It can partially be attributed to certain plot specifics, but still feels weird. Otherwise the english voiceovers are generally on the ok scale.  edit: nominated this gem for the 'Best Incest' steam award. -)",1,0

Either I have to shut them myself or they shut automatically but in this game half the time the doors are automatic and half the time they're not. Still I recomend this game because the concept and the basic mechanics are sound. This is one of the most realistic zombie games that I've played and I like that it revolves around a sense of community instead of you being a lone wolf trying to do everything. And while it can get annoying to have been playing for 20 minutes for your survivor to get fatigued and you either have to switch out for someone else or stop playing for a while, I feel like it works with the realisim.

3557386,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"After 600 of hours with Civilization V and thousands of hours on previous Civilization games (since Civ II) I can say that Civilization VI is another great game in the series. There are still a few issues that needs to be fixed in the game (mostly the AI use of warfare and diplomacy) it's still a highly polished game that changes enough in the game to feel like a brand new game and not another expension. The new cities system is cool, the active research is awesome and the overall fun and engagin gameplay makes this game excellenet. Once they will release their first major patch that will fix the AI issues and once the first big DLC will be released this will be the best Civ in the series. Until than, buy this game NOW if you are a true fan of the series, or wait for a discount if you are more of a casual player.  And I'll end the review with a short gameplay story (multiplayer with one more player): I played as China and I was in the lead most of the game (score and technology) and my friend - played with Spain - was leading with culture. I was sure he'll win the culture victory, but than I started catching up with my science victory - while the AI didn't had a chance to catch up with us. Last 2 turns to build the last spaceship part for the Mars project and he got the last great scientist, got 3000 production points towards spaceship parts and actually won the science victory before me.

4449542,342200,MechWarrior Online,"Ah, MechWarrior. I think MWO is great for what it is. The graphics are pleasing and the various 'Mechs handle just like they should. The game doesn't ask for much with system specs either, most half decent potatoes can run this game at low with at least 30 frames. I've been a long time supporter for MWO and they've added a lot. Things like new game modes, 'Mechs, maps, modules, weapons, different physics, you name it. The game isn't pay to win either (like a lot of people say) more of pay to get your stuff faster because you're lazy type of game. The two main currencies in the game are the C-bills and MC. You earn C-bills how you would expect, playing matches and are rewarded with more if you did well and less if you didn't do well. You earn MC by paying real money for it (something like $14 or $15 for 1,500 MC). With C-bills, you can buy everything with except cosmetics (EX: Christmas lights for your cockpit and such). With MC, you can also buy everything, including cosmetics.  If you're a long time MechWarrior fan, I would give it a try. But, if you arent, I would consider this:  - 'Mechs handle like tanks do. Your mech will walk in the direction it's legs are pointing, not the direction you're looking.  - 'Mechs are also multi-ton war machines the size of a building, they're slow and have a heavy feeling to them  - MechWarrior is a slow paced game, you can't just run around the map getting kills left and right. It requires you to actually think before you do, and stratagize with your team. (No respawns during matches)  For a guy like me, this game is awesome. It's great graphics and low specs means i can play it on my laptop when on the go, and it's multi-player based gameplay is perfect for fun matches with my friends. Addictive and action packed.  8.5/10",1,0

2291339,241620,Inquisitor,"Plenty of excellent written dialogue but the game is broken. it's not even mediocre. It's awful.   One of your first encounters is a spider. A very common enemy. After defeating my first spider, I noticed my character's health rapidly depleting - OH NO - I check my bags - chug a healing potion....but it's no good. The potion goes right out the hole in my stomach where the spider stung me. 80-90 seconds later I'm *dead* Are you kidding me? I'm dead in the first 3-4 minutes of gameplay? I check the internets for a cure to this spider venom, sure enough there is no cure. You have to learn a spell - but it's a level 2-3 tier spell which you can't get until much later in the game. And every cave you go into, heck even in random forests - you will encounter spiders.   The shops are so ridiculous I burst out laughing after I realized what I was dealing with. I am going to play out a scenario in the game for you:  You walk in to a thrift store and you are looking for a pair of headphones and you ask the shop owner if you have any - 'Sorry we are all out' says the blue-shirted employee. You nod. And then ask him again. He again tells you he does not have headphones. Determined you ask him a third time. He replies 'we have three in stock... But you don't have enough money'. Unsatisfied with his selection you ask him again if he has headphones. He replies he has no headphones at all including the three he just showed you. You ask again, finally he reveals to you that he has a pair of used headphones and they are cheap give you a bonus to your health points if you wear it. You buy it. You ask him again out of curiousity to see if he's holding out on you - this time he has headphones that are not used and are slightly better than the ones you just paid for.  Thats right, every single time you check a shop keepers inventory it changes. You could potentially sit there for hours until you see the scroll, sword, shield, whatever you want appear. You don't have to walk out the door to check, you simply click to speak to speak to him again.   Speaking of headphones, don't wear them while playing this game. Music and sound effects are so bad your brain will explode. The startup screen song sounds like a 5-year-old playing on a keyboard. Afte you start you get to keep listening to it over and over and over again. The bats, zombies, ghosts, spiders make painful squeals and grunts as you hit them. You will always hear them before you see them which is good because if there are spiders you'll be running for your life because if you get poisoned, your as good as dead. The only way you could sanely play this game is if you turned off the audio completely - too bad you need to hear for spiders. Seriously, if your freaked out by spiders this game won't help.  The monsters: 1/10 Where are all the demons? Witches? Why am I fighting orcs, zombies, ghosts, and SPIDERS (hate those things). I played the game for 20 hours, got nearly to the end of the first chapter and was completely unsatisified with the selection of enemies. How about a possessed man attacking me? Maybe imps? Witches? IDK - this is the scariest you can think of? The safest way to fight any mob in this game is to get your quickness skill up and run away while firing your short supply of arrows.   The story: ?/10 If you can't play the game, what difference does the story make. That's like a writer handing you all of the pages of his new book, out of order, and dirty from sitting the the backseat of his Buick Skyhawk. There will be better reviews on the story from people who can play this game.  Your companions: 5/10  You gain followers but if they die, they are dead until you gain a resurrect spell. So make sure you quick save every five seconds. All it takes is a quick spider bite. I only recruited I believe 3 companions in my time playing this game. There are a few more. They have little tiny stories but other than that.   The classes My biggest complaint is with mages. They created specializions that are really hard to remember. And when you buy scrolls to learn spells you have to buy for that specializtion to be used. I remember I bought the one that is suppose to make me posion resistant but then found out, it only does it a small percentage and got posioned by a spider anyways and had to chug 2-3 health potions.  Back to the spider - so if you get stung, you literally have to wait nearly 3-4 minutes for the poison effect to wear off. Which means, automatic death if you get stung, there is no way to avoid not drinking multiple potions. Potions can get expensive so I recommend fleeing to church and let the priests free heal you instead of sucking down expensive potions.   Boss battles and combat strategy 1/10 The trick here is simple. Summon a genie, ask him for protection. He will summon a spirit and it will do all the fighting and kill everything on screen including the boss. No need to get your hands dirty. This is not a joke. You can try to fight but you are so limited in combat options that it comes down to this - brute force and running away while fighting. Everytime. And if you don't have it or the space to run away (and you won't) you will be dead in seconds. I hope you quick saved. Demon Souls isn't even this unforgiving.  I suggest you fight the same 5 random zombies, bats, and spiders till you make enough gold to buy good equipment that gives you an experience boost. Then keep farming till you are at a much higher level. So if you see a spider, you can shoot it dead in a shot or two instead of 6-30 shots.   I can't recommend this game and unless you want to play a bad game for laughs but if you do play, do me a favor and kill a spider for me.  ",-1,0

3535466,287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Usually I either like a game or I don't. This one is tricky though.  Let's start with obvious - graphics. The visuals are astonishing. The way the game uses your personal settings in cutscenes in mind blowin. You can see your own logo, gear you were wearing on a mission just before etc. Game is beautiful, no doubt about it. Unfortunately that's basically only positive thing I can say about it.  It's a stealth game but stealth mechanics are just ridiculous. Your character will automaticaly stick to the cover (or not), there is no button for this. Guards are idiots and can be easily lured and taken out one by one. I can't count the times I lured two guards to investigate suspicious noise and then snatched one of them when they were getting back to their previous position. And when the lone soldier got back he didn't noticed anything out of order, not even that his friend is missing. Things like that make this game to easy.  And I'm haveing hard time remembering last time I've played a game with such badly writen characters and story. Hide Kojima should really stop taking drugs.  Multiplayer is also terrible and I realy hate the fact that you get forced to participate in it. If you woulnd't probably noone would play it. This base infiltration gets boreing after third one.  I did had fun playing Phantom Pain through and it took me a lot of time to get all the achievements. So in the end I think it's money well spent if you, like me, want this game for achievements.

2821824,252950,Rocket League,"Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook 'easy to learn, hard to master' kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't 'like it'. Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that.   Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as 'advising and consulting' these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get.   But with this new upcoming system, it's  literally  going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, 'lol he uses the word literally wrong'. No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped 'free' randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. 'We don't want it to make prone to exploitations', they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.  This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments.",-1,1

5207984,396060,The Rose and I,"The moment 'The Rose and I' started I knew it would be a fine example of a VR short movie, one that I would be happy to show off to others. It immediately felt  right , because it takes advantage of the fact that you're in VR. Everything feels so present and three-dimensional. The texturing of the world is well-detailed, not flat and boring. I see interesting things happening where ever I look, and in particular, the main character and surrounding scene is made far more interesting by walking around it, peering into it, looking up close to it, standing farther away. Importantly, it takes place at a scale that viewers are not accustomed to when viewing a short movie, making it far more interesting than some of the other VR short movies that have been released this month, many of which could have just as well been traditional 'flat' experiences.  I haven't even talked about what actually happens in 'The Rose and I', and there's a reason for that. Frankly, I'm not even sure what happened, or if anything really happened at all. At this early stage in the life of VR I'm unconcerned about such things. I was too busy marveling at how novel everything felt -- at how the authors really nailed the  feel  of a VR movie short -- to actually notice the substance of what happened. That's not a bad thing at all.",1,0

1533257,22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,"Fallout 3 is one of my all-time favourite games, and was one of the first games i got when i started getting serious about gaming back in 2008. The feeling of being in a destroyed neo-50's american world has a great affect on gameplay; to be surrounded by a futuristic twist on what was probably the peak of American culture while listening to tracks of American Swing and Jazz Blues while beating a Deathclaw to death after it surprise-attacked you and made you soil your pants is an experience that will only be found in the Fallout games.  The story of Fallout 3 is very reminiscent of the plots behind Fallout 1 and 2, and whilst i would say that i'd rather see a completely different story to the original games, there is far more story and content to make up for the main storyline which in my opinion wasn't anything new.  This game has allowed me to understand and enjoy an old genre of music that is found constantly played through the Galaxy News Radio station. I can't begin to tell you how many times i've listen to Bob Crosby and Cole Porter.  What this game does best and what i find Bethesda Game Studios to do best at in all their games is atmosphere and the feeling of being in the world that they are trying to portray. They did an extremely good job of capturing that post-Apocalyptic feel that aligns well with the classic games, but there are subtle differences because of the location and the different developers.  Combat is very fun, but not as responsive as some of the best shooters out there, but i'll give Bethesda credit as they are known for fantasy games where there is no such thing as fast fire-rate guns, since this is there first time at making an open world shooter RPG they did a good job at least. VATS is definitely the best part about combat, and the gore is super funny. The reaction i'd make to a super mutant's head exploding after a 32. caliber round through the skull is again one of the perks of playing this game.  There is a split of opinion between the new fans and the classic fans. My first Fallout experience was Fallout 3 but eventually i bought the older games and aced both of them, and i think all of them are great. I love this franchise and always will. I definitely recommend this game if you're new to the franchise, and then move onto New Vegas and then the classics.  Overall, i rate this game a 9.5/10. There is so much to do in this game, from taking in the lore, to the happy-go music, the rich culture and the endless gory fun, you will not go wrong by spending your money on this game.",1,1

My introduction to The Witcher series was The Witcher 2, and I thought that game was alright, not fantastic, but pretty good. Well, then The Witcher 3 came out and that game is phenomenal. After beating it, I decided that I wanted to see as much of the Witcher story as I could, so I decided to buy this one.  I knew it wouldn't be anything close to what the Witcher 3 was (mechanics/gameplay wise), but I gave it a shot. I should say that if you're coming off of the Witcher 3 and enjoyed it so much that you want to start the franchise from the beginning, you should know that the gameplay is vastly different from that game. Honestly, I would recommend putting the game on easy and just enjoying the ride because the combat is not fantastic.    Gameplay",1,0

3776902,300550,Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut,"A solid story and interesting setting that are marred by the game's execution. The actual strategy mechanics are extremely basic and slow, the UI is sluggish and glitchy, and the engine has some significant problems. Graphics and animations tend to not be important (see: Avernum) but they have the same stupifying effect that they did in Wasteland 2. It's like playing with Lego men. The UI's problems really manifest in the boring virtual reality/rigging sections, where buttons, skills, and movements frequently freeze the game and require bizarre input sequences to fix.   The combat rebalance mod takes some of frustration and monotony out of the system but a Shadowrun game shouldn't need a day 1 overhaul mod like a Bethesda game. I enjoyed the story enough that I wanted to play the fan campaigns and main story again, but trying to restart the game with the terrible beginning characters was too droll to tolerate. The skills require heavy point investment to become useful so the builds lack variety. At some point you get three instead of two action points which makes combat less tedious. The downside is that the AI never gets this bonus and the combat sequences become too simple. Instead of making smarter opponents the game just throws waves of them at you.  For the price I paid for this on sale ($1.27?) it was a good game, but the dev studio has a lot of work to do if they want to cultivate a fanbase with this new series. This is the director's update of an improved expansion to the first game, which means I have no desire to play the original reboot and am avoiding the next installment (Hong Kong). People comparing this to strategy games like X-Com or Jagged Alliance in their reviews are really overselling it.",-1,0
877121,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"One of my favorite games (and probably one of the greatest) of the previous console generation.  I played this game way after its release.

I thought that it was going to feel like 'more of the same' to me since I played Demons Souls, but it didn't. Maybe it might partially have to do with the fact that I played this years after I played DeS, but I feel like even with the similar formula it felt really fresh.",1,0

5015184,384630,Aviary Attorney,"I'm a huge Ace Attorney fan, and as such, I got disappointed pretty often by games that 'tried' or were 'supposed to be' similar to my favorite game series. Because what makes it unique isn't the fact that it is a mystery visual novel, but the lovably-strange characters, the dialogues that are so cheesy for most of the time you just have to laugh about them, the remarkable soundtracks, and also the few adventure elements do their share. And Aviary Attorney is probably the closest, and in my opinion best thing to the original games I've played so far.  Why? Because it doesn't even try to hide its source of inspiration (I mean, just reading the game title indicates that much.), it is an almost shameless copy of Ace Attorney in every aspect I mentioned above, and it's doing this just great. I've really had a lot of fun with these four cases and have no complaints about their quality, although especially the first two are quite short.  So, if you're an Ace Attorney fan: Buy this game, you will most certainly love it like I did. If you're not into Ace Attorney or even visual novels: Give it a try anyway, it might be a great possibility for you to get into both of these things (I'm not that much of a VN fan myself). But, one way or another, Aviary Attorney definitely deserves more attention.   And if you'll excuse me now, I think I'll be going back to waiting for Ace Attorney 6.",1,1

2065421,236690,Blood Bowl 2,"If you've got a few mates and think you’d enjoy some friendly banter over a fun, sports-strategy game then Blood Bowl 2 is fantastic. It’s a pretty accurate digital version of the great board game launch way back when and if you learn to laugh at your misfortune and you’ll enjoy it even more (the game has a habit of seeming to deliberately undo your best laid plans with unlucky dice rolls, lol). The campaign is simple, but a good intro to the mechanics of the game. Treat it as an extended tutorial rather than the main feature of the game. The AI customisable single-player leagues are decent, but the AI isn’t sophisticated enough to try those desperate plays in the late stages of the game, and thus becomes a bit predictable.  The multiplayer is where the real fun is to be had. There are a bunch of leagues you can enter and the community is normally made up of decent people (as with any game you’ll find the sore losers and those that just constantly complain about their “bad” luck… but for the most part people are friendly). If you can get enough mates together then private leagues offer endless enjoyment (and bragging rights)",1,0

1510341,22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"Best game in the TES series (and maybe with mods the best existing rpg). Highly technical depth of gameplay mechanics, way ahead of what is standard in current games.  The atmosphere is unique: different races got different reactions to other races (ex. racism), the behavior of the inhabitants of regions varies widely, guild members treat you depending on your rank, completed quests increase your level of reputation (universal disposition towards your character), a complex traveling system you have to deal with, ...  Wide set of attributes, skills, magic and enchanting possibilities (incomparable) allow you to create unique characters and challenge you to play and mess around with the system. At the start you are no hero, you are just an outsider. Fighting is hard and to gain wealth you have a long way to go. But in the end the story you have played is worth the time. It feels like you have achieved something and it's like a reward for your time spent in this game.  In my opinion, this is one of the best games in my library. Even though it's a bit clunky compared to modern games it has its charm and is worth playing, over and over again. I install and play it from time to time and never regret it. It takes some time to get used to it, but if you give it a try you will not be disappointed.",1,0

From the guilds you can recruit heroes, but they have a mind of their own, so to get them to do what you want you can place bounties to explore parts of the map or to kill and destroy enemies and buildings.  Heroes will level up, and will buy things from the marketplace and other such buildings using gold they get from bounties, killing enemies, or finding in chests on the map.  You can level up buildings to improve them and to be able to research new things, such as better armor for your heroes to purchase at the blacksmith, or new spells for your wizards to learn at libraries.

3466352,283640,Salt and Sanctuary,"Normally, when I review a game on Steam, I go for the more funny approach, but I have some very strong oppinions about this game I would like to share. First: Do I like this game? Absolutely.  Second: Does it have flaws? Yes.  Third: Is it worth the money? With all the stuff in it and a price of less than $20, of course.  Fourth: Would I recommend this game to my friends? Definitely, if you are looking for a challenge with a very high learning curve.  PROS + Beautiful art and model design + Combat can be fast or slow-paced, depending on your gear + Beating the bosses is satisfying, as it should be (aside from a couple, will expand on that in cons) + Holy crap there are guns + Enemies get blown into pieces when killed + The areas are all wound together in a way that allows for shortcuts + So many weapons  CONS - Fish-looking people, not a fan - The platforming can really screw you over - BS enemy placement at times - BS enemy placement in platforming areas - A couple of BS bosses    Tree of Men and Disemboweled Husk    - Very few video options (still runs well on my potato computer regardless, but still very limited) - I miss Patches...

1509056,22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"This is gonna be a long one, and for a game like this it's required. It's pretty much been stated by most of the PC Elder Scrolls community (The true way to play Elder Scrolls. Not trying to be elitest here but nothing beats the beauty of a modded ES game) that this is the pretty much the best full 3D Elder Scrolls, and the first by the community to be supported for bugs and and fixes. Why is exactly is that, though?  I'll be honest with you. To all fans who got into the series with either Oblivion or Skyrim, if you are expecting it to function at all like those games, you are going to be VERY dissapointed. This game has a very old school approach to RPG gameplay. The game does show its age in terms of graphics and visual presentation. It's much smaller than its sequels, and the animations are laughably terrible, even for its time.  HOWEVER, for fans willing to look past that and willing to get into the spirit of its gameplay, An amazing experience lies here. You're a prisoner, like pretty much every ES game ever, whose been given a chance at freedom from the Imperial Prison and has been taken to the island of Vardenfell in the Dark Elf home country Morrowind. From there you're left with a few drakes of gold and the clothes on your back, free to determine your own path, and by god do you have options.  The sheer amount of different ways quests and tasks can be completed is surreal. This is one of Morrowind's absolute best features, and is sadly lakcing the sequels. For players willing to explore, talk with people, and, god help us, PAY ATTENTION to their surroundings, there are so many options for how to progress the story. A great example starts off at the beggining (slight spoiler, nothing story breaking) where you investigate the murder of a Tax Collecter. You can choose to report it, keep the gold, investigate it yourself, help the murderer, or any combination of that and others. And that's just one tiny side quest. for players who replay, many quests can be skipped or missed.. This may come as a problem to some players but I find it adds realism in a GOOD way, where your choices and actions have impact on the world and the plot. And not in that modern way of simple GOOD or BAD ending. The is so open in choice NPC's crucial to comepletion of the plot can be killed, some are even marked for death by one of the guilds and must be killed to complete the questline for that guild. Players have to be careful, make these kinds of choices, and even risk breaking the plot. No this was not a mistake, that game even tells you that you have broken the threads of fate and doomed the world.  The world is teeming with dozens of factions, many of them competing, allies, and even enemies. There are guilds, such as the Fighters Guild or Mages Guild, noble houses like House Telvanni or Redoran, and organizations, like the Thieves Guild or the Morag Tong. All have very complex and branching questlines, with mulitple outcomes, and require feedback from the player in order to make those choices available. Choosing one can cause other factions to hate you, love you, or open up new options.   Some players may not like the indirect method of conveyence of objectives. No waypoints are in the game and the choices are not always obvious. It's a game that requires patience from the palyer and immersion into the world to find all options available. It's a game that isn't going to hold your hand and make sure you don't stub your little toes. It recognizes and treats you as an adult, and expects you to act like one and think like one.  Combat is more than likely what might drive many players away, and yeah, it's a rather annoying system. Rather than based on actual hits and reaction, combat is stat based, similar to DnD. Your chances of hitting enemies and the damage done is calculated via your skill and abbtributes verses the enemies defenses, and vise versa. Many times you will be standing point blank on an enemy and not hit him. To some of the complaints saying its glitched. IT'S NOT GLITCHED. Because of this you'll want to give some careful thought when creating your class at the begging and consider what type of character you want to play. It is possible to max everything and even overpower yourself, but at the beggining you're going to suck, so pick a focus.  Leveling is also a big problem I have with the game. At the start, you choose a set of majot skills out of the list of all available skills. You can pick a preset class or make your own. Depending on your experience in other RPGs, you may want to pick a preset and save a headeache. Regardless, skills level up through individual use. When you achieve ten total skill points in your major skills, you can level up and increase abbtributes. Depending on how many skills with associated with that abbtribute you leveled, you gain a bonus of up to 5, maxing at 100. Gaining these skills can be VERY frustrating and a grinding chore, especially if you are not into leveling skills you have no interest in using, or leveling willpower as a warrior in order to survive the ridculously overpowered high level magic enemies. My tip, you get three picks every level up. Pick two, and put the last one in luck. You're gonna need the luck. Then console command the two you picked to five points, and leave luck alone. Some call it cheating, I call it a work around to an awful leveling system.  Frustrating stat building aside there is an amazing experience to be had in the island of Vardenfell, and hey, the expansions are pretty robust too, if you want to see the capitol of Morrowind or Solsteim 200 years prior to Skyrim. For the RPG hardcore lovers who enjoy games like King's Field, Legends of Grimmrock, or the Souls series, there is a deep and rewarding challenge to be had here. So prisoner, get yourself up on deck, show your papers to the captain, get your release fee, and set off to adventure.",1,0

1896789,232430,Gone Home,"I am so glad I bought this game for a few bucks in the sale. I'd be going mad if I bought it for 20!!   The game is so not worth the hype. It basically is just a point and click adventure. Well, let's leave out the adventure. So it basically is just.. point and click.  Because of the hype around it, I expected a mind blowing story while wandering through the (very detailed!) abandoned house. But nothing! You are left alone with actually an open end. You don't get to know what happened with the owners of the house. And the thing is: You don't even care! It's not a cliff hanger! Because the game doesn't make you wanna know what happened.      While wandering through the house, listening to the answering machine, finding notes, and looking at the left overs of the owner, you listen to the story of the girl (I don't even remember in which relation she stood) who fell in love with another girl, but her girl left for the army (I think it was like that). And the parents of the girl telling the story are not okay    with it bla bla, heard it all before, average story.  But you'e got to hand it to the game that it has a really really great and detailed setting. It makes you feel comfy in the house and makes it so real.  But after finding    hidden doors and all of that,   I actually expected some kind of ghost story, or something spectacular that happened in that house. But the game gives you no impulsion on investigating further, I felt no urge to get into the story.  Nice setting, but more kippers and curtains!!!",-1,0

5624678,444530,Light Repair Team #4,"Nice puzzle game, I like the concept for sure. Could use a little bit more optimization, it was a little jittery most of the time. As another review mentioned, it's a bit tedious to aim the lights to the receptors, this could use a touch-up.   The navigation system also needs huge improvement. You're dropped in to the main area to select what level you want to play. There's no unlocking levels, you can skip right to the last level (I believe, I didn't actually try). There's no indication what levels you've completed, you have to memorize the level number you were on if you want to pick it up again later.   Overall, I'd say it still needs some tweaking but it's a nice, relaxing puzzle game and fairly priced. Many other VR devs are flocking to prices of $20+, so I commend this dev for not trying to rip people off for what's available. I hope some DLC ends up coming around with new challenges, I'd be happy to pay a few more bucks for it since I've only had to pay $6 on sale for the base game.",1,0

2272435,241540,State of Decay,"A game with a lot of potential loses a good deal of fun to play balance and game design issues.  Pros: - wonderful setting, lots of unique buildings and landscape - interesting storyline in the zombie survival genre - sandbox-y feel  Cons: - pace of missions too rapid-fire, even given ignoring many of the lesser mission requests, radio operator always in your ear with every little thing, can't tell her 'forget about reminding me about that one - I don't have time' - no time to actually investigate/explore the wonderful setting, so many places I wanted to go explore but just can't get away - so much companion mood management, always having to return to base to talk someone down - I decided to just let it go on one restart and one guy ended up shooting the preacher! - stamina management prevents extended trips away from base - you get tired pretty quickly which reduces your stamina which reduces your combat effectiveness, no way to rest up away from base, have to rely on truckers pills and coffee - thrown items have horrible accuracy mechanics, hard to throw through doorways (to get at an infestation), friends/ companions frequently get burned, no aiming mechanism so hard to tell where the molotov is going - home base mechanics are still operating even while you are offline, so that when you log back in you will frequently find companions dead, morale low, and supplies used up - some missions so unbalanced as to cause frustration, ex: was asked to retrive father's watch at ranger station - upon arriving (was home based in the warehouse at that time - so a long journey to begin with) found no less than 4 roaming hordes around the station, and the station itself was an infestation with multiple screamers - barely able to leave the area alive let alone complete the mission  So very much wanted to like this game. However, I found just a general level of frustration after each play session rather than a sense of accomplishment or interest. At first glance there appears to be this wide open world to explore, but the game mechanics felt like they were designed to circumscribe that world to a small repetitive grind nearby your base: search one building, counsel one companion, destroy one horde, run one nearby mission, return home to rest/resupply, change to new character, repeat.",-1,0

The insanely quick time to kill coupled with the entirely minimalistic HUD makes for an adrenaline-filled game from one encounter to the next. The game encourages and demands teamwork and you can often actually find people talking over ingame comms. Plus the recently added free nighttime dlc makes for engaging and different gameplay that I have yet to find elsewhere. If you enjoy FPS games and you want a game that makes you think and cooperate and is something a bit different from the mainstream FPS lineup, definitely consider picking up Insurgency.

I had no problems changing the resolution, changing any of the settings in fact, and it even automatically imported most of my control mappings from GTA IV.  I will write more about the entire game and its storyline once I had a chance to play more, but I wanted to write this much, to counteract all the negative reviews of people claiming the game is broken. I have not experienced any of these issues.",1,0
513484,202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"This is a great game, for those of you with quick reflexes and a VERY good aim (unless using a shotgun).

1989634,234140,Mad Max,"I'd really love to like this game, believe me. It's filled with things that I really adore in video games, like addictive and cool customization and a real feeling of progress. It feels great to upgrade your car from a lousy rustbucket in to a real wasteland warmachine. The combat in car and on foot is also very meaty and physical, and Is a lot of fun. There is however a single very major thing that basically ruins the game for me, and that's the difficulty. I've actually played the game on consoles for quite a while before testing it out on pc, and the problem still stands. Max is stupidly powerful even before any upgrades, and even though the on foot combat is fun and flashy, it's basically a carbon copy of the Arkham games combat system with only 2 buttons, and it gets extremely boring after you realise that the only way you can lose on foot is to ♥♥♥♥ around and try to do certain moves. The game tells you exactly when to parry, and when parrying is literally 50% of the games combat mechanics, it really makes the combat feel like a long QTE. Max also has a plethora of things you can upgrade, including armor, weapons and perks. These make the combat even more braindead, and you can mow down a huge group of enemies with basically no effort. The car combat starts out a bit more balanced, but has the same problem that on foot combat has: the upgrades. You build scarp (the currency for upgrades) wayy too fast and before you've hit the mid game point you notice that not a single car patrol is actually a threat. They cant harm your armored car and you deal ridiculous damage to them.  TL;DR: Mad Max had awesome potential, but the coolness of the upgrades is negated by the incredibly easy and repetitive structure of the game.",-1,0

2003061,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"Personally I think the Sega Genesis game tops all of the rest of the shadowrun installments...I didn't play the fps for the pc that was released a few years ago but i heard that was garbage so.... Genesis still wins out, but this version is very close to the Snes version just prettier and better sound. the game revolves around clicking to talk to people, clicking to shoot them, clicking to use inventory and or special moves/spells.sometimes you do this in the matrix (not much different from the ingame rl combat.)you have to do alot of stuff to progress from one area to the next and it can feel clunky, and slow, and if you aren't a SR fan the game then Shadowlingo can be convoluted and seem ...very stuck in what the 80's thought theyd be saying in the future.  So for nostalgia's sake I like this game, the story is ok, Chery still pops into my dreams wearing that ripped shirt , familiar characters from the first game, very true to SR story line, tons of workshop content and the abillity to create your own story (true to the pen and paper SR). And you can use your initial character in a lot of the user generated content items,deck and all. So people looking for a casual rpg with a merc-noir story and lots of add ons this game is for you. Fans of the snes and sega versions will like this. none of the above? you got 30/70 chance of liking it. I give it a solid 70 out of 100. it would have scored higher with more playable options and a revamped combat system but i think we may see that with future content from the workshop. ",1,0

Attempting to turn on the gamepad support for my wired 360 controller made it completely impossible for me to actually select a menu item to start a game change settings, or even exit the game, so I had to alt+f4 out of the game. The games graphics settings are ridiculous. My systems all far outpace the requirements for this game, but only a couple of them will actually run the game smoothly.

Come back seein my friend who just took care of a bunch of viruses i had gotten. So i hop back on to play far cry 3 and i see the 'secure uplay' thing i skip it since it didnt work before. then the cloud save breaks saying ' cant synchronise cloud saves' i try again and again to fix it but in the end it didnt work. so i hit 'skip' what i get is a not so pleasant suprise.  It shows the 'farcry 3' title in the small box before most games using uplay do before launching, to them show a black screen in the top left corner to then procede to crash before it goes fullscreen, makes any sonund at all, and then says 'farcry 3 has stopped working'. so for a few days now ive been trying fixes (8 in counting) to have none of them work. This is most likly because of the cloud saves not working and not being able to use the secure uplay account. So Ubisoft has screwed me over 20 bucks which is quite hard for me to manage to get money to spend now so im royaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If someone has had this problem before i'd love to chat.

3437192,282070,This War of Mine,"First off, this game is very depressing, VERY depressing, even the music is depressing. I can't even fathom why anyone would want to expirience the war as a good for nothing civie that decided a cabinent in the bottom of a house couldn't be used to repair the holes in the house. Not to even mention that there is no saving, tutorial for combat, backstory about the war, and even the logic is completely off the mark for what it tries to do. WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT OF A LARGE INVENTORY SCREEN THAT YOU CAN'T USE ANYWAYS?  The game is basically about surviving in a preset way where the mechanics of the game itself are unwieldy and confusing. As far as I'm concerned, every single playable character in this game is an emo wuss that can get killed by even an old man with his fists. AN OLD SICKLY MAN WITH FISTS! FISTS I TELL YOU! What kind of godamn football league is Palve in anyways!?

4855159,374030,Virginia,"I was really intested in this game and at the price it looked a bargain.   Having now played this end to end it took me about 2 hours and was an interesting albeit very strange game.  The graphic interface is ok but for me the interaction was very basic and easily led as you can just throw your mouse around and find the interactive items such as doors etc. There are some more detailed and small items to interact such as feathers, plants and glasses you can get to gain achievments and even if you stare at people for a time you get some form of achievement. However these are sometimes very difficult and the simplicity of the interface sometimes draws you away from looking at the floor or even the chair outside the lift and if you dont look you will miss things.  So now to the story line!! If you like confusing cuts and dream scenes with moody music then you may like this. For me it was a very surreal story line with a mashup of real time, dream sequences and future outcomes which were like watching pulp fiction on bad mushrooms. Im still wondering what actually was the ending and what were the investigation outcomes as there were two and i dont feel I finished them.I dont want to spoil it for anyone as its a cheap game and for two hours plus play its ok value for money. Its a real question on whether you want 3 cups of expensive coffee froth a day or play this.   The one thing that could help the game is some form of narrative. With no speaking or speech bubbles its impossible to the read the sentiment of the characters or follow the story line.

1254523,219890,Antichamber,"Imagine going through Portal without the computer to keep you company. Imagine stripping the story from Portal, and all you're left with is a mind-bending world to explore. A world where spatial relationships don't always match up with what the eyes see. Many reviewers describe this as an M. C. Escher mind♥♥♥♥, and that's probably the most succinct way to put it.  The artistic look of the game is what attracted my attention at first. The graphics are so simple and clean. They almost feel homemade. Several spots reminded me of Mike Oldfield's Music VR (Tr3s Lunas), but that's just on the surface.  Rooms shift and move all around you. Walking down a corridor may lead to a dead end, but then you walk back the way you came, and now you're in a totally different room. Walking backwards down a corridor may take you to a completely different location verses walking forwards. It's akin to being in a maze that's constantly changing, but even that isn't accurate because the world never actually changes. It's all very logical, but totally unexpected. The game is full of impossible spaces and corridors that wrap back around on themselves without curving. It really does mess with the mind, but it's all logical, and if you learn the game's internal logic, everything does make sense.  As if that weren't enough, you're then given a device that creates and destroys cubes, so now you have to get used to manipulating those. How you manipulate cubes depends on how far you've upgraded the device (I don't want to call it a gun). More areas become open to you, and they're full of wonder.  Took me about 8 hours to finish the game, and I never needed a walkthrough. It's superbly designed, perfectly balanced, and nearly flawless in every way possible. Antichamber is the most satisfyingly mind-bending game I've ever played. Everyone who likes games that are won by problem-solving and not by trigger finger needs to play this.",1,0
2962058,258180,Deus Ex: The Fall,"I recommend it with some conditions. It's not a very good game, but I still found enough fun to be worth my time. If you consider this a higher quality fan mod (which is about the level of quality to expect here, not that it is an actual fan mod), there is some fun to be had here. Obviously, expecting this to be comparable to Human Revolutions or even the original Deus Ex will only result in dissapointment.   VOICE ACTING The voice acting is pretty bad, but a lot better than I've seen from some fan mods that have tried to do voice acting. The dialogue options are extremely limited, with very few opportunities for it to make a difference.  STORY It's ok and it keeps the pace going.   GAMEPLAY A lot of areas are streamlined, probably primarily to do it being originally a mobile game. No jumping, which I disliked, but I can see why one might cut that here. It gives the designers a lot more control over where a player can go in the game without having to design additional ways to block player movement to account for jumping. This also focuses the type of gameplay they are offering, allowing multiple ways through environments.   STEALTH I liked that full stealth options were available, as well as guns ablazing.   HACKING Much easier than in Human Revolutions, but plenty of things to hack and a few good opportunities to turn robots and turrets against your enemies.   GOODS I noticed a ton of weapons available for purchase... though I never bought any. The store might be too easy to access, but it gave a lot more options than typically can be found. Everything is probably too plentiful in the game.   LEVELING Leveling up was really quick, which was good since the game was short.  ONE SAVE + BUGS I hate single save options. Just make sure when you save, nothing screwy is happening, though I found only a couple bugs during my playthrough.  FINAL THOUGHTS If anything, the game is too easy, but I still found it fun and I'm interested in seeing where things might go next, if they still planned on making another one. It's a nice diversion, as long as you don't expect much from it. Buy it on sale, if interested, and you should be good.",1,0
4611396,35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"Red Orchestra 2... What is there to say? It is a hidden gem, I'll tell you that much now, but let's get into the actual review though, shall we?  First off, let me say one thing. This game is not a casual experience. You don't simply turn it on and do well your first time, nor your second time, or a hundred times after. You will, in the beginning, die a lot. Often times, you will not even know who killed you! Sometimes, you will spend more time waiting to be respawned than in the actual game itself! But do not be discouraged, this is only a very temporary state, as you will, over time, learn which places to avoid, how to control your gun, and memorize popular enemy hangout spots.  If you are used to games like Battlefield or Call of Duty, you will hit a vertical wall. This isn't just a learning curve, this is a 90 degree vertical brick wall. Don't expect to do well, probably not even if you are a hardcore fan of ArmA, instead, expect to die very often, and expect to be at the bottom of the scoreboard.  The gameplay consists of your classic FPS features, you get to crouch down, aim down sights, go prone, switch fire modes on certain firearms, and of course, you get to shoot your gun. However, there is a feature that isn't common in the FPS market, there is a full cover system for most objects on the map, though I strongly recommend NOT using the cover system, and instead crouching behind high cover when necessary.  There are multiple gamemodes, by now, only one is being played by the majority of remaining players, and that is territory control. Those familiar with Battlefield's 'conquest' will know exactly what this is, just add the fact that one team is attacking while the other is defending. The team which has more people in one point captures it.   You will spend most of your time sitting behind cover, or slowly creeping around tight hallways with your teammates, and that there is an EXTREMELY crucial note, with your teammates. A team is extremely important, you simply CANNOT rush through enemy lines like John Rambo anymore. In this game, you are a pawn, listen to your squad leader/commander, and stick close to your team, that's it.  Guns behave very differently from weapons you find in Battlefield, and even more differently than Call of Duty weaponry. These weapons have recoil, and that recoil must be managed. No more full-auto spraying accross the whole map, no, burst fire, semi-automatic, and bolt-action rule this game.   Rifles are, by far, some of the strongest weapons in the game. Each has a five round magazine and must be manually bolted. These rifles are very accurate, but they severely lack in rate of fire. Most people will be seen with bolt-action rifles, just like in WW2.  Sub-machineguns (SMGs) are, by far, the best weapons in the game. If you can manage the recoil of the Russian PPsH-41, or the kick of the Mkb 42, you can kill just about anybody at any range with a precise hit to the chest. SMGs are, however, limited in this game, as only a few lucky individuals can claim the assault class, and be blessed with these gems. SMGs are NOT intended for fully automatic fire unless you are in a tight, small hallway. Always fire in bursts, or even better, use them like you would a semi-automatic rifle.  Semi-automatic rifles are the weapons of Elite Riflemen, once again, they are limited to a few players per-team. In the hands of a marksman, these weapons are devastating from a long range.  LMGs are surprisingly good weapons for long ranges, if they are in a stationary position, that is. Use them wisely, and always let more experienced players take the machinegunner position, as it is a great responsibility.  Remember, all of us die, even the best of players can have bad days. Stick to high cover, never run accross open fields, stick close to your team, move from cover-to-cover, and use your weapons wisely... In Red Orchestra 2, every rifleman counts. In the hands of a good commander, even a team of inexperienced players can achieve victory!  I give this game a wonderful 8/10, mostly for bugs and the utter stupidity of bots. ",1,0
4203977,323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"I've had a lot of fun with this game building my own super saiyan from the ground up. The story is good, it makes sense to have your own character that doesn't just splat him(her)self into the story for no particular reason. The combat is fantastic in my honest opinion. I love the fact that in the middle of a battle, if you exert yourself too much and run out of stamina and energy you're pretty much a sitting duck. It's intense when you see a massive blast heading at you and your thought process is 'Oh crap, I can't avoid it and I can't block it!' It legit gives you the sense of a battle in the series.  As good as the game is in my opinion, I do have a few minor 'complaints' (for lack of a better word).  -Connection issues. We've seen it, and it's improving. -No beam struggles. This bothers me way too much! -Not too much to do once you've beat the game and all parallel quests. -Doesn't seem to be a real chat system in game...maybe I've missed it, but this bugs me. -ONLY FAT BUU FOR MALE ARCHETYPE?!? WHAAAAT??  All-in-all, it's a fantastic game. If you're a fan of DBZ or fighting/brawling games in general this is a great game to pick up. ",1,0

You will need to do some work to enjoy this much, if at all, its not that hard, but a bit time consuming, and you will need a decent computer to run this even at an ok framerate, and also, you will probably need to get a friend or two to buy this game to have the maximum possible enjoyment out of this, and luckily non vr players can play too! Because I'm getting sick of all the vr only games on steam right now, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

886828,211600,Thief Gold,"10/10 Pros --Nonlinear level design with plenty of routes and plenty of secrets. --Fun toolset, especially the water moss arrows and especially rope arrows. --Light and sound fully accounted for in stealth, Non dousable lights in a marble hallway leads to a swift detection. --Higher difficulty means more enemies and less supplies, aswell as stricter and more mission objectives enemy health scaling isn't relevant when you can oneshot most enemies, you should be avoiding them anyways. --Cool as hell cutscenes. --Maps are part of the game's world, not just a screen in the pause menu. You can write notes on them and they reflect Garret's knowledge on the mission. --Difficult in places. ( Difficulty is always a good thing. ) --Can boreder on horror at times ( Constantine's manor best level. ) --No scripted events outside dialogue triggers ( which often yield useful information. )  Cons --No Autosave/Checkpoint ( Promotes save scumming ) ( a quicksave button exists, but there isn't a quickload keybind if i recall correctly ) --Keys need rebound ( takes less than 2 minutes ) --Needs unofficial patch software to run at it's best on modern software ( Tfix is your friend ) --You need to be able to read and listen to understand how to beat a level ( Takes quite a bit of efford to read that note that says 'I can't believe that nobody has heard the secret room behind the bookcase') --Doesn't hold your hand ( 'Where are the quest markers?' 'Why isn't my health regenerating?' )  Overall Thief is an almost perfect stealth game that has yet to be surpassed. If you enjoyed it. Don't forget to check out the sequel.",1,0

3111965,265610,Epic Battle Fantasy 4,"Best use of farm animals - Steam Awards Nomination 2016  To start, this game is simply amazing. The characters have their own personality (which is rare for a lot of RPG's), the enemies are stupid in a hilarious way, the bosses are random in a stupid ways. It's just beautiful. The story of the game, if what is above isn't enough to convince you of it's amazingness, is the godcat, the creator of the world, is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cats for becoming slaves to the humans, so godcat took away their limbs. Now, an unknown period of time later, godcat has returned and is going to destroy the world unless you stop it.  Other than the game being hilarious, it also has an amazing combat system that's relatively simple and easy to understand if you just try. Each enemy has it's own weaknesses (or er.. not), and each boss is unique. Each time you replay the game, you find another achievement or easter egg that just makes you fall in love with the game all over again.  If all of this isn't enough, listen to the game's soundtrack.

The base, $5 version had only two types of enemies: orcs and critters. $5 gave you 6-8 hours of dungeons bashing orcs or giants rats and spiders (sometimes both), loot that your characters couldn't use and paywalls once you reached new regions.  For PC release, the price was trippled, but they unlocked the two regions (one of which has Savage orcs as enemies, because those are so different), as well as Skelingtons and Skelington dungeon tiles. Surprise, it's still a boring slog with through mostly chaff filled dungeons, coupled with low definition 2D dungeon tiles and the best Unity graphics that tablets can muster - at PC resolution!

4644227,35700,Trine,"Trine is a delightfully charming platformer that is fun to play both by yourself and with others. Both playthroughs I enjoyed.  Pros: - Absolutely gorgeous world! The colors are amazing, everything looks crisp, and the whole game looked mystical.  - I like the switching through characters. Every character has his or her own abilities, and they are all distinct. Playing as each character is a different experience and way of getting from A to B. - Solid character controlling for the most part. I appreciate any side scrolling game with a good idea on how jumping and moving around should feel. No awkwardness here. - Playing this game made me happy. I don't know how else to explain it.  Cons: - Sometimes the game would freeze. That's never fun. - The drawing button for the wizard and the move objects button should be different! Ahh! The only button mapping that bugged me. - The segments at the beginning of the levels are dumb. You stare at a map while you wait for the narrator to finish speaking. Very rarely do narrators in a video game work. - Come to think of it, the voice acting in general was meh. - Was that even a story? - What is the point of mana? The meter would decrease but never enough to make me think 'man I wish I had more mana' because there are checkpoints frequently. - I wish it was longer! One playthrough lasts about 4 hours or so, longer if you want to level all the way up.  The downsides for Trine are definitely there, but they weren't significant enough to make me dislike this game or not want to play anymore. Trine is worth it for the stunning visuals and the fun gameplay with friends I'd say. I never played this game thinking eek when is this going to end. I didn't want it to end!

The atmosphere seems right, difficulty may be set a tad high for people new to the 4X genre of games (either that or I'm just terrible at this game haha).   There are a few bugs that need fixing, they're mainly game crashes. Suffered a fair number of them yesterday while playing Multiplayer with my friend, either desyncing or just plainly dropping us both out the game and leaving us with a window saying the other person closed the game.... If you're considering buying this game, don't let these little blips put you off, the game is well worth a purchase if you're looking for a 4X game you can get your teeth into.  Price for this game is just right IMO",1,0

3337773,274270,NOT A HERO,"I've only played the first 2 missions and I can already tell I'm going to love this game. Though it's got quite a bit of violence and some cussing, it's not super bad, and the art and humor makes up for it. It's really detailed with a lot to notice in the levels and talking with bunnylord. Anyway, I'll update this review as I play, but It's already pretty darn fun. EDIT: I still haven't played a ton more, but I did a few more missions. It's still pretty cool, nice visuals, awesome music, and interesting story.  After the 2nd mission it gets a lot harder to be perfect. On each level there are a few goals to achieve, and you can only get perfect on the level if you get them all in one run. Each goal by itself is fine, but when mixed with others it can become quite difficult. For example: Killing everyone, killing 5 without getting hit, and beating it in 100 seconds all in one mission. It sounds fine, but some of it is a bit annoying. Still fun though.",1,0

2003411,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"Shadowrun Returns is an excellent, engrossing, and enjoyable tactical RPG. It does come highly recommended; sort of.  When the game originally released, it came with the default campaign known as 'Dead Man's Switch'. It's enjoyable, with some memorable characters, but there were complaints about it being too linear with too much focus on straight gunplay. Now obviously, that is still available. There's also tons of mods for custom campaigns.   There was a DLC for this game, called 'Dragonfall', which was superior to the base game in almost every way. Now in order to get that, you need to purchase 'Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut'. Buying this title here will not grant you access to Dragonfall anymore, sadly.   I personally recommend both titles, but at this point it would be best to wait for this title to go on sale, and pick up the seperate Dragonfall game ASAP.",1,0

I ended up asking for a refund, as much as I hate doing so, because I couldn't play more than 70 seconds without needing to shut down my entire computer because the game did stuff that wouldn't allow you to shut it down when the game glitches out.

To break the staleness of trading, I would sometimes go bounty hunting/Combat Zones/High RES sites. Started with the Sidewinder just like everyone else. Then, I bought a Cobra, traded that in for an Imperial Courier once I was Rank 3 (Master) in the Imperial Navy. Kept the Courier until I was Rank 7 (Baron) and bought the Imperial Clipper (For the Emperor. Bask in his Greatness). Upgraded to a Python and traded my ♥♥♥ off until I finally got the ship I was waiting for, the Anaconda. Once I earned another 80 million, I bought a Fer de Lance and am currently using it as my dedicated combat ship, while keeping the Anaconda as a dedicated trade ship.

5161370,391730,Crashlands,"Imagine if Don't Starve and Terraria had a child. Now imagine that child grew up and got hours more content than its parents, and got rid of all the emotional 'inventory management' baggage their parents were carrying. Then he joined a comedy club and acquired an actual storyline that doesn't suck.  He also saw his parents involved a lot of walking across half the procedurally generated map just to collect a few things or to retrieve your inventory after dying, so decided you can teleport freely wherever one of the generously spaced warp pads are, and that death (which if you're playing on Insane, will happen A LOT) doesn't mean dropping literally everything you own.  The child then decided being only on PC sucked, so it visited iOS and Android and was smart enough to get vaccined against the dreaded 'IAP' disease that was endemic there.  That child is Crashlands. It has a few flaws (like why don't more people know about this game aaargh) and minor bugs, but this is one of the most flawless indie sandbox releases I have seen on Steam, especially with all the pre-alpha early access nonsense going on lately. Right off the bat it has content rivaling Terraria and Don't Stave, with combat and gear resembling an aRPG, without the micromanagement chores of either (although if you are playing on higher difficulty levels and want to min-max your gear you will have to grind some).  It has an infinite procedural map, easy building, tons of crafting recipes, sensible progression, a long storyline, quests and side-quests, farming, fishing, pets, interesting combat, boss fights, rare loot and unique legendary gear, a unique social platform called BscotchID, achievements that unlock side-content IN OTHER GAMES, and WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE GO BUY IT ALREADY AAAAAHHH.

You actually feel like you're trapped inside the dungeon; you actually feel scared when you know there's a stronger enemy ahead, instead of simply being more careful; you actually feel that if you take damage you're screwed, unlike some games  *ahem* CoD *ahem* . Honestly, the only not so great thing that I can think about this game is that *sometimes* you move 2 squares instead of 1 because you tapped w twice by accident, which may cause you to fall into a pit.

Yes, Hello Games did kinda lie about multiplayer, but I didn't buy the game for that. I've been playing the game for just a few hours but I'm in love. I love going to planets and searching all over it and finding all kinds of things. The lore is done really well because it's not constantly thrown in your face and you slowly disover it on your own.

But I have an issue and everyone says the same thing, which I tried and refused to work! The story of my first problem goes like this:  I had just come home from an overnight field trip in the state capitol. I wanted to play Portal 2 because I was so close to the last chapter! When I loaded the level I tried something out, but I ended up dying. The old Apeture logo was filling in like it does when you respawn, but when it was full Portal 2 crashed. Every time I died in that level it would crash. Eventually the game would refuse to even load my progress. It goes through all those pictures and stuff but halfway through loading it would crash. Today I tried launching again. It has been 1 month since I tried, and when I clicked 'continue game' it just showed the background of the menu and 'Portal 2' at the top. It wouldn't load. I left it for about 30 minutes and it still refused to open anything at all. I had to restart the game and it happened again. Everyone says 'just verify the cache' or whatever.

The game has a story mode that can be played with another player, and has unlockable characters. There are a few levels, but each of them feel fresh with the different themes and obstacles to avoid.

1060692,217200,Worms Armageddon,"//My hours of playing do not at all display the amount of time I have really been playing this game//  Again one of those games who has shaped my childhood. :) Yes it is indeed an old game, has it aged well? Yes indeed it has! I have been playing worms revolution, ultimate mayhem, clan wars, and even the lovely early worms-mod for halflife 1(which was one of the best 3D 'installments' of this frachies, even though it was created by fans) and I must say none of the installments has the same madness, fluidity and 'simplicy' as Worms - armageddon. And I must say I'm not one of those 3D worms haters, but it is hard to not hate or dislike many of the 3D installments for bad grafic engine, bad controllers, lack of the atmosphere and madness and such. My review is also lacking the singleplayer part because I have never played it, I have only been playing this with my friends and I believe that is also what this game is best for :)   Okay lets take the cons first, shall we :) - Needs a DLC or patch with more weaponary (okay one thing first, armageddon do have the best selection of weaponry and a customization and so on compared to the others) but when you have played armageddon a lot and have played some of the later installments with some of their few new crazy weapons, you do miss some of those from the newer installments. - Sometimes the bots can be rather stupid, normally they are quite average, nothing really to complain about, but a few times I have experienced some stupid bahaviors from their part XD - Thats it, I can't really come up with anything else. Sorry!  And here it the PROS! :) - The simplicity! No simplicity does not mean it is boring and plain, not at all. From my perspective the best games has always been the simple one, not those who tries with lots of special effects or twisting plots(With plotholes) to hide their lackness, but those games who are simply being what they are, nothing more, nothing less. Worms armageddon is for everyone, from little children to grown ups, it is easy to start with, but hard to master. And even if you have mastered the game, luck still has to smile upon you in a battle with your friends. :P - Fluidity. Both the grafic and the playthrough are indeed very fluident, so smooth compared to others and especially clan wars which still lags even with a really great gamercomputer 'cause of a stupid grafic engine. - ZEE CUSTOMIZATION! In a multiplayer game you can custom anything from your teams, to the map, the game modes, time, drops of crates, starting health, weaponry, the ammo(infinite bananas! XD) and strenght of the weapons. So much to do which can really change the gameplay totally. I just love it! all the opportunities, but which is presented in a simple way so even a totally newbie would be able to understand. - Mulitiplayer gameplay, fair play. Okay without any doubt it really does help if you have played this game many times before. But still when it comes down to it, luck is a big part of it. I cannot count how many times I have been beaten by newbies because of this. It makes it fun for everyone and challenging in a non frustrating way. - The styleart. Even though it is vey simple and cartoonish, I think that is what makes this game so charming, it is so pretty in its simple cartoonish styleart. - It works with every computer(I don't know about mac and linux)! I have been playing this on windows millennium, windows XP, windows 7, windows 8 and windows 10. Maybe I'm lucky but I have had no problems at all both with the CD version and steam version. - Bananas? Infinites Bananas? Bananas with max blast strength? The only weapon, which you have, is bananas? now that is indeed fun!! Blast your friends with a high chance of killing lots of your own worms :P   Worms armageddon is meant to be a simple game filled with fun and madness in a way which are enjoyable for nearly all ages. :) And in my opinion this game does not only beat all other installments in this franchies, it is one of the kind. :) No wonder why so many people have falling in love with the franchies ^^ because even though it is purely violence, it is violence in this fun and silly cartoonish way that you cannot complain about it :) Aged well, just as a good wine ^^",1,1

1081781,218230,PlanetSide 2,"This is the dream shooter if you're a certain type of player. It fulfills the promise of Battlefield 2. Remember squad based com and objectives setting? Remember driving to the front in a variety of vehicles while planning strategy? And large scale? This game does all these things, and better. Communication, team strategy, opening up new flanks with mobile spawn points, a flanker class, combined arms, a map with strategic features that lives and changes, coordination in a small squad up to a platoon of 48 or several platoons, ...in short team strategy and tactics in large scale shooter!   What's more, they got the pay to play (not pay to win) model right and the development model is a thing of beauty. Here we have devs playing all over the game, in clans (or 'outfits'), broadcasting and generally dialoguing with the players all the time. Rich community. They have a roadmap where players set dev objectives. They iterate and patch nearly at the level of a League of Legends. And all in discourse with the players. Heck, there are many continents to come.  Other stuff: sniping as a real thing (not strictly CoD style twitch sniping), stealth against real human beings, vehicles (tanks, atv's, fighters, gun ships and transports), emergent story up the wazoo, whole swathes of the game that emphasies priorities other than twitch shooting (ie. leading w teamwork/objectives, hacking systems, healing, repairing, spotting...)   There is much to dig into and learn to up your game. This is a great, great shooter. It's f-in' free. Check it.",1,0

The gun customization is awesome and alot of fun to try different things. The developers are constantly improving this game to make it a great experience for the players.

5656159,45100,Secret of the Magic Crystal,"Every few weeks, I have this dream that starts off on the grand staircase of a beautiful and elegant hotel lobby. As I take in the magnificence of the scene, I suddenly spot the figure of a woman with her head covered in a red scarf leaving through the front doors. Her form captures my gaze and all else fades from existance. A thought sears into my mind in a sudden moment of clarity: 'I must know her name!' My feet start to carry me down the stairs, soon skipping two or even three steps.  Now in a full sprint, I stumble out the front doors to find myself absorbed into the crowd of a busy sidewalk. My eyes dart furiously across the chaos and I catch a glimpse of red in the backseat of a taxi pulling away. I quickly hail a cab and soon we nearly catch up. Without warning, traffic surrounds us and I am separated from my mysterious stranger. Lost and hopless, I look up and see that I have arrived at a harbor. The gray of the sea envelopes me and I sink into an all-consuming despair.   But wait! My eyes fix on to a swaying speck of red gliding down the pier. As I race down the squeaky planks, I find my stranger looking out to the vast ocean. Pleading, I shout: 'Please! I must know your name!' She slowly turns her head but her face is buried behind a wall of auburn hair. Softly, she whispers: 'Secret of the Magic Crystals'. I wake up in a cold sweat in a tangle of sheets.",1,0
3346750,274940,Depth,"After playing a few hours of this game I feel like I'm ready to write a review.  The basic principle of the game is Sharks vs. Divers (2 vs. 4) in which the Divers have to follow a slow moving robot called 'S.T.E.V.E' who will lead the players through an underwater ruin/cave system and crack open bountiful safes full of treasure along the way. It is the job of the Divers to protect your robotic companion from, you've guessed it, the other players who are the hungry Sharks.  Now I was surprised by how well put together the controls were as both the movement of the Divers and Sharks and all the animations are fluid and realistic. Everything feels responsive and how it should, which is a good thing in a game were it can take less than a couple of seconds to end up in the stomach of a great white. The levels are very atmospheric and each has it's own ambiance and 'vibe' and can be easily differentiated from one another, though there are only 5 maps in total right now which is a shame. The graphics are also polished to, and some levels do look simply gorgeous.  The gameplay works well, though it feels some maps favour the Divers and others favour Sharks slightly more, but with that said I have won and lost on all the maps so the essence of balance has obviously been carefully considered by the developers, and the game also requires an element of skill to play. No side is more powerful than the other which is what I was praying for when I installed the game. The sharks have their pros and cons, as do the divers, and both have special abilties/weapons they can upgrade with a points/monetary system. Divers build cash by collecting treasure and safely deopisiting it in S.T.E.V.E and Sharks gain points by gaining and chaining kills together.  Overall the game is extremely fun and is nothing like anything out there on the market. It is the best 'Jaws' game I have ever had the pleasure to play and it's a good thing to see developers managing to bring unique ideas to fruition. There is a lack of content with only one game mode and only 5 maps, which does feel steep for the price but I hope in time that there may be free updates or some reasonably priced DLC.  It is hard to explain what genre this game is though... at times it's an action game, and then it also feels like a horror game, which is rare considering it's multiplayer only (that, and the setting and game mechanics make this title stand out to me). All-in-all, it's definitely worth a buy.",1,0
3454405,282800,100% Orange Juice,"A board game that relies completely upon one's ability to simply admit defeat from the get-go. You will go into this game expecting a fairly innocuous and casual romp best enjoyed with friends, and leave it screaming like an animal, cursing your very existence along with anyone who has wronged you while playing. Expect nothing and remember that when you're in the lead, your demise is right around the corner.   After hours of playing this game online, I've adopted an almost zen stoicism; if I'm two tiles away from completing an objective, I know I'll roll a one and get warped to the other edge of the map.

That said, I once more took a chance on Total War with Warhammer and so far I am very surprised! The game has been released in a decently optimized and complete state. The base game seems solid so far. Also although I had my doubts Warhammer IP fits Total War extremely well.  Unit models look great, voice overs are well done. Combat while quick is rewarding. I haven't updated my rig in years and it runs very smoothly on High-Ultra settings. They have a good base here, this is actually one title that I am excited to see what DLC comes out because the base game is worth playing.  Give it a chance, you may be surprised just like I am.",1,0

2536577,247000,Talisman: Digital Edition,"I would only recommend this game for playing with other people,   Recommended not playing against the AI  .

Worth mentioning is the option to play with people Locally, Online or AI.  This game does have potential to be very fun, just make sure it's with friends, be warned however, I'm not responsible for any friendships broken from friends stealing each other's gold, items, Or plainstraightforward Assassinating while playing the Assassin hero... (that's op as hell, provided you start the fights).    The biggest downside to the game besides the AI is:   The games can be drawn out really long and lasting for up to 3 hours.  The game itself is relatively small, between 700-800mb, so truely; test the game out for yourself then rely solely on reviews by other people, Your tastes aren't the same as my tastes and vice versa; Just give it a go, you may warm up to it.",1,0

5583391,442070,Drawful 2,"Drawful is a Jackbox Party Pack game. This slightly updated sequel is sold as a stand-alone.  All players must be able to see the host's display, by being in the same place or streaming online. Each player is given a prompt to draw a picture based on, then false prompts are written by your opponents and everyone tries to guess what the real one was. This is all faithful to the first game.  New features:   Two Colours   - You have a light and dark colour to draw with. You still don't get an eraser, though.   Custom Prompts   - Writing your own clues adds a whole new dimension to the game, since the same sense of humour that goes into the false answers may have been involved in writing the real ones, and players might recognize a prompt they wrote. You can also 'publish' sets of prompts and share the seven character code with others on the game's discussion boards if you wish.   Streak Bonus   - Get extra points for finding the true prompt multiple times in a row.   Options   - You can set the game to extend the drawing timers, and adjust several other settings through an options menu.  These additions are welcome, the presentation is updated, and Drawful 2 is a game that can stand up on its own merit. However, the similarity to the original Drawful may make it redundant if you already have the former, unless you really want the ability to write custom prompts.",1,0

Insane maps are more insanely huge than ever. In-game cinematics and dramatic event art join the massive improvements to graphics and overall presentation. And that’s just off the top of our heads.'

2026829,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"Like a PvE version of Chivalry.  Pros: - The ambiance is nice - Each level has a different feel to it - True co-op experience (you have to communicate to win) - Nice difficulty challenge - You really feel the weight and impact of your weapons (like in Chivalry)  Really not much to say here. It genuinely feels good to smash rats for hours so it's hard to write what's good about the game, it's just fluid and fun.  Cons: - A little buggy at times (my friend got stuck behind librairies, some creatures sometimes get stuck,...) but I'm sure it will be fixed at some point - The ally AI is kinda dumb but it's balanced by the fact they can teleport to you if you're too far away so it's more a 'meh' than a con  If smashing rats heads with a big hammer or cutting them with an axe doesn't thrill you, I don't know what will do... Setting rats on fire, maybe?",1,0

1238660,219740,Don't Starve,"Definitely Incredible. Survived 24 days in a ginormous stone safehouse, decked with iceboxes and chests. Built farms surrounded by wooden walls, and surrounded my entire camp in traps. However, despite having a nearly endless bounty of resources, and food, on the 25th day they came.   On the 15th day, I outran them. Dark, cold, and terrified I ran large circles around my camp (under construction at the time) feeling like safety was an antique memory from a distant life. These black monsters chewed through stone trying to get me. WHAT THE HELL WAS I UP AGAINST? You know its bad, when it says 'too dangerous to sleep.'   Almost 10 more days would pass before they would return. Almost..  I knew that I wouldnt be able to survive another late-night ambush unarmed, so I decided to study the ways of the arcane. I built myself an ice staff, after a 4 day gold-hunting journey that led me into a wormhole. Though I was thrilled, I didnt feel any safer. I decided to take my golden pickaxe to work, and really mine out these next 2 days. I created a mining helmet, so I could eliminate the need to go back to my campfire to stay safe.   Upon my arrival home, I decided to barricade the living hell out of every side of my camp, making it a fortress.  As if unrealistically short days, and dangerous nights, famine and fear werent enough, Winter was coming.  *john snow voice.*  It seemed to come out of nowhere. My rain-predicting machine must have been on the fritz, or the morning frost must have frozen it, because it went from clear to christmas in about 4 seconds. As I lit my fires for warmth, and put on my winter hat, Maxwell decided he had heard something. Just like winter's blistering onset, the monsters were back for a vengance. Cigar in my mouth, bandana, and 2 m42a's in hands (ice staff and my spear), I showed them just how cruel humans can get.    However, they devoured every little bit of me down to the gandalf beard.  10/10 would die again.",1,0

It ticks all the boxes I look for in an interesting game - It’s developed in a country not known for their dev studios, it discusses a very real and very important question and it’s technically well executed.   But I can’t recommend it as it makes the cardinal error for an interactive experience - it’s plain boring. The theme of parental abuse is overstated and the metaphors crude, but all that could be forgiven if it was only fun to play. As it stands it’s a run-of-the-mill 3d puzzle platformer with unimaginative puzzles with no story telling.   Should be played by hardcore explorers of the modern gaming medium due to the reasons in the first paragraph or if you need to write about it. Otherwise stay away.",-1,1

835153,210170,Spirits,"Spirits is a short name for little ghosts that pollinate plants in a magic forest. This amazing puzzle game is in lower levels very easy to play and turned out in the last levels as quite challenging. It reminds me mostly of Lemmings. You have either these special abilities like digging through walls (bashing), blowing other spirits over gaps or blocking wind streams as a bloated spirit which you can assign to each of them. Of course then its life is lost. The aim is to bring as much as possible of them to the great magic swirl. Additional the spirits are reacting on windstreams but mostly they must be bewared of walking or floating into dangerous spikes everwhere. Dumb as lemmings ... In a level each plant must be pollinated and a certain number of spirits must survive to solve the map perfectly. Your world rank is even breakdown to each level and will be permanently updated after playing. Not many people have seen the last levels it seems. And also the least achievements to make the last levels all perfect are quite rare. But lots of fun to do them.",1,0

There are few cons though one is it's length i heard it's short but i did not think it would be this short. This game is meant to be played as a trilogy with your save file transferd but it's actually hard to get immersed in the story with this length good rpgs as you know take many hours to develop a connection with your charcter and other charcters. proberly the worst con is a desing decsion when your low in health or have brain damage in battle the game fades out like when you watch white noise on a tv it gets unplayble it's a mass effect special effect i think in new installments it could be done more suttle. There are a few issues with background sound sometimes being louder than the voice acting and with problems with closed captioning. At launch there was a few game breaking bugs i found only two bugs playng with patch 1.1 there is a time in the game when you might have to do battle but your on a chair all you have to remember is to get off the chair it may seem simple but when i saw the game glitch out i thought the game was broken. Summing it all up this could become a very good rpg with it's same lentgh in new installments i dont think it could price wise it's ok it may be too hard to make it longer for the need of higher sale price, proberly a smother launch will help too.",1,0

I bought this on the basis that I really enjoyed The Stanley Parable, and saw a number of positive reviews.  It takes about an hour and a half to complete, and there isn't so much a game to play, but more a message to listen to, and it is in that whether you will enjoy it or take something away from it. I would assume if you were more interested in human psychology, that it would prove to be a more interesting and worthwhile experience, but to give some balance to the review system I have to vote negatively as it didn't do it for me.  I guess it made me realise that the bits I most enjoyed about The Stanley Parable were the puzzles and the humour, which this lacks, although it's worth pointing out that this game was neither intended to be humorous or a puzzle game.",-1,0

Ofc he was not even half good as koreans getting stack up on around C rank on battlenet. He was always mentioning back then stories about how great few players from our country were: 'Draco', 'Dunaj'. He was pumped up to play and play only this game, organising sparrings with his clan, for most time. Although he ended up as an smart guy in society not related to games, getting a good job, opening buisness, soon propably mariage too.  Into the thing I am getting is that gaming aswell as anything others demands sacrifices to make money for it, gaming is an passion that's why if it comes only to income, then progaming is not good spent time. SC is propably at least for me, the most competive game from all demanding skills in every aspect. I was never good at it, but I appreciate the players. This VN is an tribute to all competive gamers for now. Its something fresh. It has incredible graphics, great music combined with classic SC tracks. Dynamic story telling. Decisions even if not that many. I am surprised that noone wanted a money for that hard work.  I recommend this game with pure assurance, that you will find here something for yourself here. As long as you like visual novels or you are respectfull towards competive gamers. Thx for reading the whole thing. Also you need some knowledge and memories with SC to have full joy from this.",1,0

Skill differences are not to be taken into account and teams are randomly made up as well. Most of the time, you end up running around with 5 medics and not a single one takes the time to revive one or another, and if that isn't the case, there will always be some level 25+ guy on the stacked team to ruin your game experience even more.  Game is currently slightly Pay to Win and since it's a free to play steam game, it will have a lot of hackers, griefers and idiots. Later on, it will also heavily turn pay to win as there are special abilities and loadouts that are only available for some real dosh.  EDIT: 28. 07. 2015  The game didn't change a lot, they added some new mercs, which are your pre-defined loadout-classes and that's about it. The matchmaking is still horrible and you end up having stacked teams most of the time, and ping is a huge issue. The hit-detection is so screwed up, that when your opponent has a very high ping, and you don't, you end up missing even though your little hitmarker shows you that you've hit the enemy.

It's generally considered to be of critical importance that the track is readable and consistent. Thumper says that ideaology is bunk and and puts presentation front and center. The two major consequences of this are that it 'feels' really good to play when you are in the zone and doing well. There is a lot of visual reinforcement for nearly every action and it really is a pretty unique experience in the RA genre. The other consequence of this is that any kind of mistake generates a lot of implicit punishment. That visual reinforcement becomes visual noise that you have to see through to try and recover. The audio stutters and breaks when you make a mistake, making it that much more difficult to find your flow again. Whether or not you doing well, Thumper is a noisy game.  This kind of presentation extends to effects where you do things right as well -- 'Thumping' on a gem from the air (An action that is not only good, but generates a bonus for the player) causes the track to stutter for an audio effect and generates a big graphic that ripples along the entire track, distorting it all along the way. Coming from a more traditional Bemani line up of games, these kinds of effects feel extremely disruptive and I honestly shy away from doing them lest I generate more noise in an already noisy environment.  The contrast of the world doesn't help. Often times you'll find gems on the track colored bright blue, along with the rails, the background and some of the 'tunnel' objects. It makes parsing the screen pretty difficult at time. The contrast of the track 'notes' ranges from acceptable to very questionable throughout the game.  Beyond that, there are a handful of track layouts that are borderline not fair. You don't get a reasonable amount of time to actually react to some elements, specifically some turns that come out immediately after another turn. These are pretty rare, but encouraging memorziation as part of learning a track is generally Not Cool™.  I'm ragging a lot on this game and pointing out stuff that irked me some, but I think it's as important to note that I really do enjoy this game and in the whole scope of things, the game is very nicely polished and delivers a truly unique experience that moves the needle in an interesting direction for the RA landscape. I can't wait to check it out in VR!  If you are a hardcore RA purist, then be ready to make some track readability concessions in favor of graphical and audio flair, but if you just want a fun, unique Rhythm game with an emphasis on presentation, then you really can't go wrong here.",1,0
4310745,33230,Assassin's Creed II,"With the release of Middle Earth - Shadow of Mordor, theres no real reason to really buy Assasins Creed games unless you want alot of wasting time, a story that dousn't make a whole lot of sense and never will, and in general a completely inferior product to ME:SOM. ME takes everything that sucks about AC series and fixes it basically. AC2 is just much of the same of AC1 and retains all the issues that game has while throwing in more stuff some of it adds to the game while most of it is just tacked on and dousn't really add a whole lot to the gameplay. Along with a story thats loosey goosey stupid crap, if I wanted a crap story I would watch a Stallone movie (outside of First Blood Part 1) or Govenator Von Gun Grabber movie. This story is idiot tier presentation to the point that sneaking up to listen on a conversation amounts to standing a couple yards away from these guys in ruins feild and then Etzio is shocked that they realized he was there. Its like Jesus, porn comes with better stories than this.  I havn't beaten the game yet but thus far I have encountered a number of issues and it seems to be a not very good game as its to similiar to the first in its repatitiveness and screwing around.  Some problems are -No Challenge, its stupidly easy. A small child could beat this game and isn't definitively better than 1 or really that diffrent aside from a few small additions.  -Extremely stupid AI that can barely play the game The AI dousn't really offer any real challenge unless you get ganged up on, even then just way till they attack one by one then counter them which instakills them most the time. And if not just Jam the attack button until you win. Im still relatively early so I expect more enemy types later on. The AI is so stupid though they will jump off a building and die. I seen it happen, or they just stand there going through a few lines over and over basically amounting to them saying (hey, whose that guy there) until there bar fills and they realize your the guy they are supposed to kill. AI also patrol inside buildings and not much else, its so terribly bland for such a big name game and literally breaks the entire plot when immersion is lost due to just stupid AI quirks.  -Sounds missing, which makes for some awkward moments when cinematics have no sounds regarding something supposed to be dramatic.  -Free Running on buildings and up walls has a tendency to grapple onto something you don't want or send you jumping off a building you hadn't wanted to jump off of   I have seen people claim they never in the time they played the game had their character jump anywhere but where they intended and that if this happens to you its because your bad. These people are outright lying. Struggling with the camera and free running design is especially a problem in 2 partially thanks to more geometry for the character to jump onto or you will just randomly jump off a building and not lock onto anything even though you should have. Its random at times.  Also another issue is the design of buildings and geometry itself, so many areas have spots where you feel you should be able to climb up but the next ledge is just slightly out of your reach so you just stop and have to go around. Its terrible, slow, and clunky, and I feel like Im just wasting time trying to figure out how to climb up a stupid building instead of just going around it at times.  -Pop in and poor draw distances   People just appear from nowhere in front of you, or they are just a few yards away and have polygon heads that look like some PS1 or early PS2 crap.  -Not well optimized for PC release  I cant get above 60fps and VSync is off, the FPS does drop in some areas aswell and the graphics look like a console game, which isn't okay for a PC game that can look far better especially when pop in is noticable. Though the game does look good/satisfactory  -Controls required downloading custom preset/mod to get them to be usable and not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unfortunately they are still flawed, a combined fast walk/pickpocket button means you do both at the same time, which is terrible because you do both at the same time.   -Fluffy, lots of time wasting to make the game last longer and missions that just have no real point but to make the game longer. This BS is what makes AS series so crap thus far. I would rather have a 5 to 10 hour game where I really enjoy it instead of 18 hours full of time wasting.  -Plot is hard to follow if there even is one. And its constantly getting in the way of gameplay. Etzio and Desmon are barely even characters. They are uninteresting and empty.  This is the product of a bad port job, either setup the controls yourself or be lazy like me and find someone elses configuration work.   +Its like the 1st game The first game was good, and a solid third person action game though extremely repatitive. This is still continues with this game, unfortunately not always for the best.  +Graphics can look pretty good, till you notice something bad that throws the table.  +Era is nice to see 'alive'. If you consider alive mostly static, unfaithfull to history, with artistic liberties and game design requirements in place, still its nice to atleast imagine how the world was so so long ago.  -Setting is just a reskin of the AC1. To the point that its just a bunch of reworked textures with much geometry.  -Extremely padded, the game actually makes you go out and find all the codex pages to continue. This junk is usually reserved for optional collectibles like it is with the feathers in this one.",-1,0
4701765,360940,The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare,"I'm only giving a positive review for the dev... :steamfacepalm: This game basically crashes every time I go to play it. It freezes up and doesn't actually ever make it in-game. And to make it worse, when it freezes, It stays over EVERY OTHER WINDOW, no matter what, alt-tab, alt-f4, etc, nothing gets the window out of the way. I can't even get the task manager window over the mean greens display to force close it. The rest of the pc seems to work fine, I can access my windows menu, and my taskbar, I can open other apps and view files but I cannot get the freaking mean greens display ouf of the way, so not only can't I play, but I can't use my pc in general after tryin to launch your game, and I was forced to power down to get my pc back.... Please fix this! I've never expierienced a problem like this, EVER. This 'glitch' or issue seems sketchy as hell, and I want it fixed:steamsad::steamfacepalm:   Final words of wisdom, I don't recommend this game because I can't really. I can't even play the game (for whatever reason) and even worse, the game gives me this bizarre issue, (which I've never had in my many, many years of gaming.) I got super hyped when I first was this game because it brought back a flood of memories from Sarge's Heroes and the other army men game from N64, and I was more than dissapointed for the reasons listed above.   That being said, it still looks like a great game, and I'd be happy to enjoy the game and give it a new review when my problem is resolved.    Edit: Online seems to be dead when I managed to try and play a bit the other day on my friends pc; also that means it's probably an issue on my end as to why I can't play properly.",1,0

3302226,271820,Card City Nights,"Card City Nights might be the best adventure game about playing a card game since Pokemon Trading Card Game for the Gameboy Color.  I play a lot of games and most of them I don't play for very long. I am a casual player and don't have the patience for anything 'hardcore' or otherwise overly time consuming. So I usually play fairly shallow 'casual' games and then figure out what the mechanics are and get bored, or I try deeper games and then the difficult ramps up too high for casual play.  So far this has been a game which I keep going back to because the difficulty ramps up gradually, introducing interesting variations on the core mechanic. For instance, I built an attack-heavy deck and was coasting through most battles until I got to an opponent that had a better attack-oriented deck than mine. I was at an impasse, but then one of the characters recommended that I try going for disabling cards instead of dealing direct damage. Great suggestion! Now I'm thinking future opponents will try this strategy on me and I'm considering adding more revival-type cards to my deck. What I appreciate about this game is that it's got me thinking about strategies without going into hardcore deck building territory. However, it's not a shallow game like you find with, for instance, most mobile games. There's a story, characters, and a progression of mechanics so you're not just playing the same board over and over. It's the perfect mix of narrative and strategic depth with casual play.  I got this game on sale on a whim and now I wish there was a Kickstarter because I'd like to give them 10x what I paid so that they will make more games like this. I guess I will just go buy all their other games too! Good job you guys, you've made a fan. ",1,0

2004400,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"Having been a fan of Shadowrun for the SNES, this game had all the right touches to give me that old school nostalgic RPG feel to it.   First off, it's not marred by bad voice acting, mainly cause there is no voice acting. Everything is text, so prepare to read. This normally sounds like a bad thing (cause you ain't here to read, but you here to game!) but the dialogue is good enough where you actually don't mind it. It really is well written and some of the conversational rebuttles truly are funny. Which leads me to my next point.  The game is quite linear. This is a classic case of a glass half full/empty. I found this a refreshing change from all the latest RPGs as I tend to get lost in all the open world games because there's just too much to do. I lose track of what exactly is the main storyline and almost never finish the game. This one, I beat in about 14 hours, so know that there's an 'end' to it.  While it may seem short, there are user made missions which you can do after, so the replayability is always there. Plus, if you know your way around their editor you can make your own! (I can't, I'm too dumb).  Also, the game plays out in sequences, or chapters if you will, and you can't save between them. Some of these sequences are long, so it kind of becomes a pain if you need to go.   That said, here are my pros/cons to the game.  Pros Battles are fun (you get to fight in the matrix!) Dialogue Character customization Old school RPG feel  Cons Too short! Somewhat linear Save points   Overall though, I enjoyed the game. Its definitely not perfect, but it's definitely worth it's price. I would say this gets a 7.5 out of 10 from me! Enjoy!  ",1,0

2410946,243120,,"Betrayer is first person action adventure game set in The New World, 1604. The player is set to a part of Colonial America where the horrific truths remain undiscovered. The game world is open area in each section which allow player to collect clues and search for better gear to survive from relentless world.  The gameplay is about collecting clues and conducting investigations to learn the past of lost souls. Thus, it will reveal the truth behind the colony. Thanks to Blackpowder Games, who had worked on games F.E.A.R. for creating of two different worlds that allow player to switch and play major role to solve the puzzles. The silent New World is full of hostile conquistadores and Native American warriors while The Otherworld presents you an uncomfortable and depressed world as it stripped with black-white and red to indicate the important stuffs. It looks stylish and serves well on game theme, but you can adjust color saturation if it’s not your taste.  The combat is simple FPS game, even on normal difficult. The enemies are deadly and straightforward in AI pattern. You need to take them out quickly which force player to use bow most of the time or rely on inconsistent stealth mechanic. There’s no voice narrative, all you need is to read from scarp papers to gain information and seeking for right NPC. The map marker and smart fast travel are useful enough to avoid player lost in track.  Overall, Betrayer offers a short but impressive experience with unsetting and strong atmosphere. Although the combat is quite unbalance and puzzles are too simple, the feeling of horror/mysteries game love is back as the credit start to roll.",1,0

I have my computer set to use my Nvidia graphics card (760M) on everything, but for some reason this game was set to use the intel one instead.

I no longer play console games, I'm strictly PC. That means I'm searching for a game which can satisfy my Gran Turismo need. I own several racing games for PC such as Grid 1, Shift 2, Dirt series, Need for Speed, and I only use an Xbox One controller. Grid 2 has become my goto racing game when I have time to sit down and spin some tires.  I have heard that Shift 2 is better, but so far I have not been able to get into it. After work and time with my family, I don't have a lot of time for gaming. So when I finally have a moment to race, Grid 2 is where I turn.   Gamepad control works well, it is challenging enough to keep me engaged while not being so realistic that I get frustrated since I don't have a wheel. The visuals are excellent and that includes vehicle damage. Plenty good enough to please my tastes.",1,0

4666476,359320,Elite Dangerous,"I want to love this game so badly. It looks stunning and the scale is spot on. This game make you feel smaller than an ant and flying around systems at 25 times the speed of light can be amazingly terrifying. You don't know fear until you unexpectedly come out of super cruise at a neutron star in full throttle while checking a text on your phone, then franticly trying to escape it's pull knowing if you don't you'll be paying hundreads of thousands of dollars on insurance as well as lose all your exploration data. That being said, I've put hundreads of hours into this game, yet still feel like I've done and acomplished absolutly nothing at all. You'll be jumping from job to job because their all boring, (I've tried bounty hunting, mining, trading, and exploring and they all feel one inch deep and 1000 miles wide, and in this case that 1000 miles is literal distance you have to travel) then you'll eventually give up and quit the game like most players before you. This game is the most mind numbing grind I've played in a long long time. The multiplayer is boring in the base game, yet very hard to play right in Horizons, and planetary landing with a friend a near impossible to cordinate. On top of that, expansions are going to total at least $250 on top of the $60 for the game, making this a $310 game just to have a complete version, and you're sure as hell going to buy them because the base game feels so empty. Overall, I would recommend waiting for at least a few seasons of expansions to come out befor even considering buying this game. If it's in this state when No Mans Sky and Star Citizen release, it has no hope of competing.",-1,0
3041678,262280,Dungeons 2,"Dungeons 2 is a very nice game based on Dungeon Keepers, it has its unique way of telling a story and playing it doesnt get boring easily.  So the main focus on the game is that of a dungeon manager. Build your dungeon with all types of different rooms, serving all types of different purposes. There is quite a lot of content in the game, which justifies the steep price for it. It 's also quite polished and rich. It can get a little boring during the planning stages of the dungeon gameplay part. But nonetheless very amusing. When youve built an army youll head up to the overworld where good is oh so obviously present. From unicorns to the almost cliché good forces including wood elves, dwarves and knights in shining armor. Visually Dungeons 2 is very satisfying, though it lacks any strategic involvement of you in the RTS style battles. There isnt really any depth in the overworld fighting part. But that doesnt at all weigh out the fun in the dungeons.  Last, id like to mention the narrator of the game. He also narrates the Stanley Parable. The narration is very funny and often plays a role in the game as big as the gameplay itself. The narrator makes countless references to things like the Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter etc. Also the self conscious humor about fantasy clichés the game uses, and lack of certain mechanics the narrator humorously points out.   In the end Dungeons 2 is a very amusing game. It isnt at all perfect, but is does what a game should do: show you a nice time. If you like fantasy RTS dungeon managers, this is your game. Dungeons 2 is a very honorable homage to the Dungeon Keeper series.",1,1

957105,212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"This review states the pros, cons and who this game is best suited for:  This game is great for people who like the management, survival type games. Resident Evil type management comes to my mind, but with more focus on decision-making rather than shoot 'em up, even in the fighting aspects. This game provides a solid (not impossible, not easy) challenge in actually beating the game.  Pros: Difficulty-This game provides a great degree of challenge, gauranteeing a solid amount of game play time until finally beating the boss. Strategy-As mentioned, the strategy in this game consists in proper management. Do you buy a weapon now, or wait for a ship upgrade later (like cloaking or crew teleporting)? Do you buy fuel now or hope to come across ships? Which weapon you want in front of the other? What do you choose to upgrade? Updated-This game has been recently updated. The specific updates aren't worth mentioning to the new buyer, but that is has been updated should speak both about the success of the game and the commitment to it being a quality game by its developers.  Cons: Getting Screwed-Very rarely, but it does happen. A scenario may occur where you just can't handle it. An unlucky fire may be set in your oxygen room while you're busy fighitng off rock men after just losing a key crew member to giant spiders one jump ago. Crew teleporting-I don't know if they fixed it in the update, but it is unfair and demoralizing in my opinion for your crew to be left behind by accident. Both of these cons should be considered minor issues, as they are by no means 'game ruiners'  Repeatability- This by far plays the biggest factor in this game. The lure of beating seeing the boss for the first time and getting crushed, wanting to win. This game does a fantastic job in enticing you to keep playing until you win. When you win, the satisfaction is great; you feel like the success is evidence of finally understanding all the tricks of the game. And for the most part it is. Once you win, wanting to play this game no longer feels as significant. From this point on, it feels that you set your own challenges now: Can I get and win with the stealth ship? How about the harder difficulty?  Despite the repeatibility, the amount of gameplay that this game has to offer until it's gone is a good amount and quality of time. I still play this game, but I wanted to give fair warning about beating the boss. If you want to further extend the enjoyment and gameplay time of this game, I suggest NEVER playing easy mode when you get it.  Either way, for those who like the survival-management strategies, this game pays off a great deal!",1,0

Like with most indie games, the art style is what makes it shine. It has a cartoony yet sick and twisted art style. The game itself has little replayability sadly, but is extremely hard... dragging it on... and on... and on... and while that might sound bad it's actually what kept me playing.

2400176,242920,Banished,"Really good game but not nearly as complex as some people would have you believe. Once you've learned the extent of the stupidty of the AI and how to build to compensate for it, the game isn't much more than a food production and distribution simulator. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, depending on what you're looking for. It's the game's simplicity that allows you to tinker without worrying about your entire town collapsing because you took your eyes off the ball for half an hour as you looked around the map for where you wanted to build next and how you wanted to do it.   Unfortunately, the simplcity also extends to production and building types, both being severely limited. Easy enough to fix with mods, though. Unfortunately, what is not fixable with mods is the AI.  Is it worth $20? Depends on what your expectations are. If you want a fun, simple city builder that has no real point beyond the aesthetic, it's well worth it. If you want a game that appears just complex enough to let you feel like a pro and haunt the game's forums, regurgitating basically the same thing that's been said half a dozen times already in the same thread then this is the game for you.  But if you want a game with complex, intuitive AI and the ability to control more than just where stuff gets built and how many people work there you may want to wait for a sale.",1,0

5569900,440,Team Fortress 2,"Back then it was the coolest game ever, with fantastic character design and art direction, fun and balanced gameplay. I had so, SO MUCH FUN! Cool server mods, awesome community, lots of depth, and a lot of servers actually tolerated micspamming music and dank maymays! Now it's age and evolution have destroyed every bit of enjoyment you can get out of it.   Cheaters are all over the place, grouping up with alt accounts manned by bots, using spinbots, clearing server chat at every frame and namespoofing other players in order to get them unjustly kicked or banned.  The matchmaking system put community servers in a chokehold. Now all there is left are 12v12 'matchmade' casuals ridden with cheaters, premium community servers with pay2win plugins that give actual cheats to whale players, servers filled with cancerous mods and plugins and manned by power-hungry moderators/admins (a surprisingly high amount of them being kids) who ban randoms for whimsical reasons and have a tendency to abuse their powers.  The art direction got completely ruined by cosmetics. What used to be an insane, warmongering, badass soldier now wears pink, flaming rabbit ears, a pink santa beard, a spartan hat and a golden rocket launcher with christmas lights around it... And can also ride a magical broom... Oh dear.  The crazy amount of unoptimized meshes added by playermodel cosmetics gave a lot of weight to the game files and made tf2 run no more on older machines which used to run it flawlessly.  Even after so many years the game's overall gameplay hasn't changed that much. Random crits are still there (unless competitive play, for which you have either to authenticate yourself with a phone (no thanks), or pay (even if you have bought the game when it wasn't f2p ... ♥♥♥♥ move.) Also note that this was done in order to prevent an influx of cheaters and smurf accounts. Needless to say it didn't help at all). The game is still oriented towards zoning, making explosives so powerful that the only mechanic that manages to really shake a game is the medic's übercharge. It now mostly boils down to 'spam a choke point, wait for medic uber, attack, rinse and repeat'. Casuals are a blind spamfest (12v12 in rather small maps, which is way too many players) where tf2's long respawn times kill your enjoyment. Competitive is much better though.  MvM is tons of fun for a while, then quickly gets boring.  And let's just not talk about class balance.  TF2 was the best damn game I had played for a long time. It's first big updates were steps in the good direction, but valve suddenly caved in to greed and added a cash shop and trading, which started the game's downfall...",-1,0

As always, there are downsides to this altogether brilliant game, mostly basic features that other RCT games had: - Inability to sync coasters in stations - Inability to build boomerang coasters - Inability to build multiple stations (as well as building seperate entrances and exits) - Clunky path building system  If you were not a hardcore fan of the RCT games and just enjoyed playing them casually, then this IS the game for you. If you like to build real theme parks, then you may find yourself having a pretty frustrating time every now and then.  In conclusion, the game itself is fantastic, and is easily worth £30, but you may find yourself wanting more in certain aspects, although i'm sure Frontier will end up delivering missing feature in due course.

2499400,245280,ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition,"I watched tons of Monkey King in Chinese growing up and loved it even though I didn't understand it. It was great to see how the staff, cloud, monkey, pig and the even the crown were re-imagined and fit in the world.  You start with a whole world where you're trying to figure out who are these people, why are there murder robots everywhere, why did the world 'end'? Unfortunately by the end of the game you don't really know that much more about the people, some plot points felt super blunt while others felt too vague. The pacing towards the end feels rushed and is probably the worst part of the game. Nothing really feels really resolved and it was a very deus ex machina ending.   Traversal was bearable at first and made sense with the monkey king influences but, after a while it became a boring hold direction/mash jump until you're done. Even worse than say an Assassin's Creed because most of the climbing sections were linear vs the more open nature of AC. Using the cloud was great though, it felt good and looked good while using it though transitioning   The gameplay kinda followed the story with a solid premise. An okay Arkham Knight like combat with basic shooting but, as the game went on it the mechanics on top of it didn't feel great. Offensively the upgrade tree didn't provide much variety or even options. The limited options it did provide felt super inefficient compared the the standard mash quick attack.  Shooting in this game felt pretty unwelcome. It was slow and clunky and unfortunately became more mandatory as the game progressed. There were segments later on in the game where I'm basically &lt;travolta.gif&gt; because I'm being shot at by by enemies I can't melee and ammo is somehow scarcer than health.  Honestly I think the game is worth an hour or two of your time but, it isn't worth seeing through to the end.",-1,0

5650609,449830,,"This my first time experiencing MUV-LUV asa visual novel. I backed the project on kickstarter merely on a whim (300 dollar tier).  I read the twitterfeed and played EXTRA first. This review will be based on the first hour and a half of playing through Muv-Luv Extra.  You take the perspective of Takeru Shirogane a teenager who is actually a genius mech pilot...at least that's what the first two minutes of EXTRA are teasing only to find out that all a dream. You're actually just a normal Japanese high school boy being awoken by your childhood friend Sumika as part of a daily routine. Along the way you meet your other classmates Meiya, Tama, Sakaki, Ayamine and Marimo all of which take up stereotypical heroine roles in this visual novel such as the transfer student who you promised to marry when you were kids, the class rep, the underclassman, etc.   Now I've played plenty of visual novels, and I thought that extra was gonna be dry. I was really tempted to start unlimited first to jump into the drama but digressed after reading the twitterfeed. Boy am I glad I stuck to playing extra first. The character reactions are so hilarious (even if they aren't animated) and every character (including the dog) just meshes so well together.   Another feature I like is when you close the game and open it again you start off in the same spot as before so you don't have to accidentally worry about accidentally closing the game without saving. Second is no text boxes, just text.  The music is pretty catchy and the visuals are more than just character cutout portraits. Overall, the hour and a half I played just passed by in an instant. I'd recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys visual novels or is just starting to get into visual novels.  ",1,1

Obstacles in your path aren’t just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else you’ll add precious seconds to your time. It’s always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so that’s never an issue.   Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits — so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the game’s environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. There’s no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload.   Animations are a bit simplistic, but that’s never much of an issue with this game, or many others really, since that makes it easier to predict your own movements.The dubsteb/dance soundtrack is incredible and among the most catchy I’ve heard in a long time.The traditional sound effects of boinks and the like for jumps and springs work well, and managed to fit the genre while clearly making sure that the music is the star of the show.   If you don’t like the default soundtrack, you can always customize it. At a mere $10 on Steam, Rush Bros. offers up a lot of fun for very little money. Anyone who loves precision platformers will enjoy it quite a bit, as will fans of dance music, as the OST is full of it and it’s all good stuff.Rush Bros. came out of nowhere, but is a very polished game worthy of any gamer’s time.",1,1

Came back and had 50 billion in 3 days of being in an... Got ban again... Third times the charm so the day I got in an I was back with $500 billion...

18710,10090,Call of Duty: World at War,"The story mode can be summarized with 'Run that way, kill those dudes, and capture the objective.' The multiplayer is typical post-Call of Duty 4 mechanics. But, come on, we all know that at this point, you're not buying this game for the story or the multiplayer. You're buying it for the Nazi Zombies. And fortunately, they're all here. Through the grace of Gaben, all the DLC is included with your game with no extra purchases required. You get all four zombie maps included and ready to play. And all the multiplayer maps too, if that's what you're into. Somehow, though, the multiplayer is still pretty smooth, with hackers being all but absent from play.  I give this game 5/5 free map packs for being functional, having a mode of play that's still likable almost six years later, and for existing before the Call of Duty franchise became synonymous with 'repetitive'.",1,0

4132505,319830,AX:EL,"Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.  Check out this review and others at Nouse Gaming:  http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/  ------------------------------------------------ I'll admit I went into AX:EL with some fairly high hopes. Having recently got into War Thunder with some friends I was looking for some fun dogfighting action and the 'undersea' mechanic had me interested.  The first impression of any game (whether you realise it or not) is from the main menu screen and other elements of the GUI (Graphic User Interface) This is where AX:EL hits probably its biggest problem. The interface is at best poorly designed and in truth feels like an afterthought. Whilst a simple utilitarian GUI is never great it's better than having an overly stylistic and confusing one like AX:EL. Navigating the menus is a task in itself and especially in the hub where the cut off words on buttons and lack of tool tips means that I've very little idea of what's going on.   The poor GUI really shows through in the 'Hub'. The Hub is where you buy upgrades and paint jobs for your ships. The problem is it's very difficult to tell exactly what you're buying and what it does. There seems to be a fair amount of customisation to your ship. I say seems to be because despite the large number of buttons and sliders it didn't seem to actually do anything.  The game also looks pretty poor. The texture quality is downright abysmal and even the plane models look like they're from the early PS2 era. Whenever you get close enough to anything be it enemies, the ground or the aircraft carrier you immediately notice how bad it looks wrenching you out of any immersion you may have had. And for the most part there's not much to look at, most of the fights take place over or under an empty ocean.  Graphics however aren't everything. It's been proven again and again that even with bad graphics and GUI a game can still be great, just look at 'Consuming Shadows' for a recent example. AX:EL's game play however is about as good as it's graphics. Upon starting it up and finding the controls strange I decided to rebind them which lead to, interesting consequences (LINK:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYy3j0_ZPn8)   (The Developer has since responded to this and fixed it)  Having reset to default and after a bit of playing around I somewhat got a hang on the controls and then set about on the missions which are the standard fare. Go here. Shoot down these things. Find the plot point etc. With a completely forgettable story the game boils down to navigate the space and dog fight with anything that comes your way. The problem for this is that you feel like a tank with wings. The plane is so totally unresponsive to your input so the fighting is a long chase until you eventually manage to luck out and blow them up. And how about the underwater mechanic? Well it's exactly the same as in the air. As in I didn't notice a single difference besides the blue tint to the screen and the obnoxious bubbles that come off the back of your plane. No slow down, no different controls or feel to the flight. This meant that the underwater component feels very much like a gimmick, not even one that much effort was put into.  AX:EL is a title that I can't recommend at all. All it offers is some poor quality dog fighting and there are far better options out there. I mean with War Thunder being free to play there's nothing that AX:EL offers over it.",-1,0

Me and my friends play together on online and we recently did some of the heists. In fact, We're almost done with completing all of them. Plus, Rockstar recently added stunt races, so those have been fun as well.

5187241,394230,Battleborn,"Game OverWatch ?  # fine free weekend Beta, game rushed, to be or not to be after Overwatch, unfinished, repetitive, optimalization, bad decisions, flawed matchmaking, skill floor, heroes imbalance long time... ------------------  Just cause (Pros) °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° NOTE: Only if you have time, patience, friends, skill or Support will, and Nvidia :)  PVE co-op, Borderlands-like, but more and more hack n slash options, unfinished, repetitive, DLCs, the 30 heroes kinda save it, hero building and spec (skill tree, loadout), depth and complexity, witty gameplay, elements of dis and dat (tower defense, horde mode...)  fun PVP, skill-based, casual meets hardcore, i dont play Dota or so, BB feels classic and like home for me, no glorious f2p community (yet?), well it scales from the greatest to desperate times... see below  Just why (Cons) °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° 'Matchmaking' Why no Quick match from game release? Why no Server browser? Why no big open lobby? Why no Solo queue option? (no premades)  versus organized premades, premades vs. low levels, low player base, waiting times, no skill-based matchmaking. those always make a population death spiral.  low levels who should l2p in PVE mode, skill floor.   bugged private party - can disconnect some players somehow   Grindy grind to win, git gud loadout. (Yea, you can tell it doesn't matter and fair play... when two same skilled players and only one with great loadout)  git gut extra inventory and loadout slots, with credits or $, just cause grindy ...dis is not f2p game! (yet?)  Season Pa$$ (so far) 1st 'Mission Pack'. ummm... dis?... the Pack? so the repetitiveness continues... 'delegated-ware'? 'PVP-ware'? only worth the credits you save on bonus heroes. just cause grindy.",1,0

956665,212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,An indie classic and one of my favourite games. I still haven't been able to beat it after countless hours on the iOS version. Always a different experience on every playthrough. Worth every single penny 10 times over.,1,0

1636641,225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,STRONGLY RECOMMEND!   I am a little upset that there arent more games like this. I have not finished this game yet but its great. I am a natural born Ambi and this game was soo engaging for me. One hand controls one person and the other controls the other. I love it soo very much! I wish there are more games like that as it was so exciting for me :)   Graphics are INCREDIBLE! and story is VERY touching!   GET IT!!!,1,0
